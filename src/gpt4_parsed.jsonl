{"title": "Delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia: effect on brain edema.", "abstract": "The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2-h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied. Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded. In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO. Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested. The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO. Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory). The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining. In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups. In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05). The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05). The data indicate that phenylephrine-induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core, that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction.", "abstract_id": 1711760, "entities": [{"entity": "Hypertension", "qualifier": ["induced", "2 hours after MCAO"]}, {"entity": "Brain edema", "qualifier": ["in the ischemic core"]}, {"entity": "Hypertension", "qualifier": ["induced", "2 hours after MCAO"]}, {"entity": "Brain edema", "qualifier": ["in the periphery of the ischemic territory"]}, {"entity": "Hypertension", "qualifier": ["induced", "2 hours after MCAO"]}, {"entity": "Neuronal injury", "qualifier": null}]}

Five Chinese patients with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency were genotyped. The five patients derived from four families living in Shandong Province, China. The diagnosis of 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency was initially established through HPLC serum adrenal profiles in Qilu Hospital, China, from 1983-1993. Three CYP17 gene mutations were identified from these patients. Among them, V311fs and Y329fs are two novel frame-shifting mutations. V311fs is an 8-bp nucleotide (TTAAATGG) deletion in exon 5. Y329fs is a deletion-insertion combined mutation (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 in exon 6. Two homozygotes for Y329fs and one compound heterozygote for Y329fs and V311fs were identified from three different families. Two homozygous sisters for the D487_S488_F489 deletion were identified. The results confirmed the diagnostic value of the HPLC serum adrenal profile for 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. The D487_S488_F489 deletion had been identified in two previously genotyped Chinese families. In our present study, a third Chinese family with this mutation was identified, suggesting that this mutation is a prevalent CYP17 mutation in the Chinese population. The identification of Y329fs mutation in addition to three previously identified mutations at codon 329 suggests that codon 329 is an unstable point of the CYP17 gene. The mutations identified from our five patients appear to be random, but the recurrence of the Y329fs mutation may be attributed to a founder effect.

Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact-control, saline-control, melatonin-treated, BCNU-exposed and BCNU-exposed plus melatonin. Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery. Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined. Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU-exposed cortical dysplasia group. There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes. Malondialdehyde level in BCNU-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups.

In IEC-6 crypt cells and jejunum enteroids quantitative RT-PCR showed a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of lpa2 in response to \u03b3-irradiation that was abolished by mutation of the NF-\u03baB site in the lpa2 promoter or by inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases with CGK-733, suggesting that lpa2 is a DNA damage response gene upregulated by ATM via NF-\u03baB. The resolution kinetics of the DNA damage marker \u03b3-H2AX in LPA-treated IEC-6 cells exposed to \u03b3-irradiation was accelerated compared to vehicle, whereas pharmacological inhibition of LPA2 delayed the resolution of \u03b3-H2AX. In LPA2-reconstituted MEF cells lacking LPA1&3 the levels of \u03b3-H2AX decreased rapidly, whereas in Vector MEF were high and remained sustained.

Overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and hypertrophic growth were not impaired in muscle-specific GLUT4 knockout mice, demonstrating that GLUT4 is not necessary for these processes.

APP/PS1 mice and KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice were subjected to Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory deficits. Glia activation and neuron loss was measured by immunostaining. Fluo-4AM was used to measure cytosolic Ca2+ level in \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) induced reactive astrocytes in vitro. KCa3.1 expression was markedly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in both A\u03b2-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice.

{"title": "Lack of major involvement of human uroplakin genes in vesicoureteral reflux: implications for disease heterogeneity.", "abstract": "Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the retrograde flow of urine into the ureters and kidneys. It affects about 1% of the young children and is thus one of the most common hereditary diseases. Its associated nephropathy is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in children and adults. Recent studies indicate that genetic ablation of mouse uroplakin (UP) III gene, which encodes a 47 kD urothelial-specific integral membrane protein forming urothelial plaques, causes VUR and hydronephrosis. To begin to determine whether mutations in UP genes might play a role in human VUR, we genotyped all four UP genes in 76 patients with radiologically proven primary VUR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of all their exons plus 50 to 150 bp of flanking intronic sequences. Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, seven of which were missense, with no truncation or frame shift mutations. Since healthy relatives of the VUR probands are not reliable negative controls for VUR, we used a population of 90 race-matched, healthy individuals, unrelated to the VUR patients, as controls to perform an association study. Most of the SNPs were not found to be significantly associated with VUR. However, SNP1 of UP Ia gene affecting a C to T conversion and an Ala7Val change, and SNP7 of UP III affecting a C to G conversion and a Pro154Ala change, were marginally associated with VUR (both P= 0.08). Studies of additional cases yielded a second set of data that, in combination with the first set, confirmed a weak association of UP III SNP7 in VUR (P= 0.036 adjusted for both subsets of cases vs. controls). Such a weak association and the lack of families with simple dominant Mendelian inheritance suggest that missense changes of uroplakin genes cannot play a dominant role in causing VUR in humans, although they may be weak risk factors contributing to a complex polygenic disease. The fact that no truncation or frame shift mutations have been found in any of the VUR patients, coupled with our recent finding that some breeding pairs of UP III knockout mice yield litters that show not only VUR, but also severe hydronephrosis and neonatal death, raises the possibility that major uroplakin mutations could be embryonically or postnatally lethal in humans.", "abstract_id": 15200408, "entities": [{"entity": "Uroplakin genes", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Vesicoureteral reflux", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms", "qualifier": ["in Uroplakin genes"]}, {"entity": "Vesicoureteral reflux", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Missense changes", "qualifier": ["in Uroplakin genes"]}, {"entity": "Vesicoureteral reflux", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Major uroplakin mutations", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Humans", "qualifier": null}]}

In this study, we developed a new hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat. We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney. With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model. Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models. Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeled-positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model.

SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the HMG-box motif (high-mobility group-box), which acts as DNA binding region. Deletion and inactivating mutations of SRY are among the known causes of XY sex reversal. Here, we described the screening of 10 patients who presented with 46,XY sex reversal for mutations in open reading frame (ORF) of SRY gene. DNA was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques. A 609 bp fragment from the central portion of the SRY gene was amplified, using primers XES-2 and XES-7. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into the pUCm-T vectors, and direct sequencing were carried out on an ABI 377-3 automated DNA sequencer to detect the mutation. PCR-restriction enzyme digestion was applied to detect the results of DNA sequencing. In two patients,de novo mutations led to an amino acid substitution. An A was replaced by a G in codon 38 upstream of the 5' border outside the HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamate by glycine. Another heterozygous T to A transition at the nucleotide position +387 which encodes for a Tyrosine (Tyr) instead of a Term, whereas her father was proven to have the wild-type sequence. These point mutations have been confirmed with PCR-restrict enzyme method. As demonstrated by the Human Gene Mutation Database analysis,homology search, and review of the literature, these two mutations were not described previously and brought the total number of SRY gene nucleotide substitutions (missense/nonsense) to 45. These findings indicated that these amino acid substitutions may be responsible for the sex reversal,not only inside the HMG-box but also outside the HMG-box.

Cloning of the full-length DOCK8 cDNA led us to define that the DOCK8 gene encodes a protein consisting of 2,099 amino acids. DOCK8 was expressed in a variety of human organs, including the lungs, and was also expressed in type II alveolar, bronchiolar epithelial and bronchial epithelial cells, which are considered as being progenitors for lung cancer cells. DOCK8 expression was reduced in 62/71 (87%) primary lung cancers compared with normal lung tissue, and the reduction occurred irrespective of the histological type of lung cancer. 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine and/or Trichostatin A treatments induced DOCK8 expression in lung cancer cell lines with reduced DOCK8 expression. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, were indicated to be involved in DOCK8 down-regulation in lung cancer cells. Further screening revealed homozygous deletions of the DOCK8 gene in a gastric and a breast cancer cell line. DOCK family proteins have been shown to play roles in regulation of migration, morphology, adhesion and growth of cells.

Both the mutagens' sensitivity and the efficacy of DNA repair may be affected by variation in several genes, including DNA repair genes. The hOGG1 gene encodes glycosylase of base excision repair and RAD51 specifies a key protein in homologues recombination repair. Both can be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions, which can contribute to stomach cancer. In the present work we determined the level of basal and oxidative DNA damage and the kinetics of removal of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 gastric cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals. The metrics from DNA damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of common polymorphisms of the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes: a G-->C transversion at 1245 position of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser-->Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G-->C substitution at position 135 (5'-untranslated region) of the RAD51 gene (the G135C polymorphism). DNA damage and repair were evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) assisted by DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), preferentially recognizing oxidized DNA bases. The genotypes of the polymorphism were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. We observed a strong association between gastric cancer occurrence, impaired DNA repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between that genotype and stomach cancer occurrence in subjects with high level of oxidatively damaged DNA. We did not observe any correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired DNA repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA lesions.

In the current study, the haplotype structure of the PTPN22 region was determined, and individual haplotypes were tested for association with type 1 diabetes in family-based tests. The 1858T risk allele occurred on only a single haplotype that was strongly associated with type 1 diabetes (P = 7.9 x 10(-5)). After controlling for the effects of this allele, two other haplotypes were observed to be weakly associated with type 1 diabetes (P < 0.05).

Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed. The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data. Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale).

Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl.

These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue, frequently precluding surgical resection. Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We have shown that MPNSTs express neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly understood. Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on collagen type I or fibronectin. The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated human and murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Both baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II. In contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lines and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1 alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells. These findings suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1 alpha differentially modulate this process.", "abstract_id": 19306381, "entities": [{"entity": "NRG-1 beta", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "MPNST migration", "qualifier": ["on laminin"]}, {"entity": "NRG-1 alpha", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "MPNST migration", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NRG-1 beta", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NRG-1 alpha", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Akt", "qualifier": null}]}

Tak1(col2) mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion. This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1 and Gdf5-deficient mice.

TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways.

Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and/or HBeAg negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and an HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM-resistant clones. However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV. In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro.

Recently, heterozygous REN mutations were shown to result in early-onset hyperuricemia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To date, only 3 different heterozygous REN mutations have been published. We report mutation analysis of the REN gene in 39 kindreds with hyperuricemia and CKD who previously tested negative for mutations in the UMOD (uromodulin) and HNF1B (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b2) genes. We identified one kindred with a novel thymidine to cytosine mutation at position 28 in the REN complementary DNA, corresponding to a tryptophan to arginine substitution at amino acid 10, which is found within the signal sequence (c.28T>C; p.W10R). On this basis, we conclude that REN mutations are rare events in patients with CKD.

Anemia was severe and disproportional to the degree of decreased kidney function.

Tubular proteinuria and oxidative stress were induced by a single injection of maleate (400 mg/kg) in rats. Maleate-induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl \u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), upregulation of kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels. Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups. Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture. In addition, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate/glutamate as substrate. The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished. All the above-described alterations were prevented by curcumin. It is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate-induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage. The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production.", "abstract_id": 25119790, "entities": [{"entity": "Curcumin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maleate-induced nephrotoxicity", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maleate", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Renal injury", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maleate", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Mitochondrial oxygen consumption", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Curcumin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Oxidative stress", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Curcumin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Respiratory complex I activity", "qualifier": null}]}
{"title": "Neuroprotective effect of neuroserpin in oxygen-glucose deprivation- and reoxygenation-treated rat astrocytes in vitro.", "abstract": "Neuroserpin (NSP) reportedly exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemic animal models and patients; however, the mechanism of protection is poorly understood. We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms. Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured the cell survival rate, relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-\u03b1 related to NSP administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proteins related to the NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt pathways were investigated by Western blotting. To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-\u03baB pathway, a NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection. We found that NSP significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. It also reduced NO/TNF-\u03b1 release. Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKB\u03b1/\u03b2 and P65 were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration. The NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by NSP administration. Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes. The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of NO/TNF-\u03b1 and repression of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.

However, little is known about TIPE2 in lung cancer. Our study aims to clarify the role of TIPE2 in lung carcinogenesis. We examined the expression of TIPE2 in lung squamous cancer (LSC), small cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) tissues and found that TIPE2 expression was lost in small cell lung cancer, compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. Overexpression of TIPE2 significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer cell H446 in vitro and even suppressed tumor formation in vivo. Flow cytometry analysis found TIPE2 overexpression promoted apoptosis of H446. In TIPE2 over-expression cells, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax were significantly up-regulated while Bcl-2 was down-regulated. Moreover, coincident results were shown by immunohistochemistry in tumors from nude mice. TIPE2 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, while promoting the phosphorylation of P38, but had no effect on I\u03baB\u03b1 and ERK pathway. Taken together, TIPE2 promoted lung cancer cell apoptosis through affecting apoptosis-related molecules caspase-3, caspase-9, Bcl-2 and Bax, possibly via regulating P38 and Akt pathways, indicating that TIPE2 might be a novel marker for lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.", "abstract_id": 25946186, "entities": []}

Ectopic Star-PAP expression inhibited proliferation as well as colony-forming ability of breast cancer cells. In breast cancer patients, high levels of Star-PAP correlated with an improved prognosis. Moreover, by regulating the expression of BIK (BCL2-interacting killer), Star-PAP induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells through the mitochondrial pathway. The growth of breast cancer xenografts in NOD/SCID mice was also inhibited by the doxycycline-induced Star-PAP overexpression. Furthermore, Star-PAP sensitized breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs both in vitro and in vivo. In mammary epithelial cells, Star-PAP knockdown partially transformed these cells and induced them to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

An important recent study has also shown that the initial toxicity produced by paclitaxel in patients was highly predictive of long-term outcome. In this study, we therefore focused on defining the mechanisms of acute toxicity produced by paclitaxel treatment on primary sensory neurons under in vitro conditions. In primary rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) culture with paclitaxel, an increase of pERK and pp38 was observed at 2 hours, and this was accompanied by an increase in expression and release of C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). There was no change in pJNK. The increase in pERK was sustained at 48 hours of exposure when the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and IL-6 was also increased. IL-6 and CCL2 were colocalized to TLR4-positive cells, and all these responses were prevented by coincubation with a TLR4 antagonist (LPS-RS). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that DRG neurons developed spontaneous depolarizing fluctuations (DSFs) in membrane potential and hyperexcitability to current injection but no ectopic action potential activity at 24 and 48 hours of paclitaxel incubation. However, CCL2 applied to cultured neurons not only induced DSFs but also evoked action potentials. Evidence of oxidative stress and mitotoxicity was observed at 48 hours of exposure. These results closely parallel the responses measured in the DRG with paclitaxel exposure in vivo and so indicate that acute toxicity of paclitaxel on the DRG can be modelled using an in vitro approach.", "abstract_id": 32694383, "entities": [{"entity": "Paclitaxel", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Primary sensory neurons", "qualifier": ["acute toxicity"]}, {"entity": "Paclitaxel", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "pERK and pp38", "qualifier": ["increase"]}, {"entity": "Paclitaxel", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CCL2", "qualifier": ["increase in expression and release"]}, {"entity": "Paclitaxel", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "TLR4, MyD88, and IL-6", "qualifier": ["increase in expression"]}, {"entity": "TLR4 antagonist (LPS-RS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "TLR4, MyD88, and IL-6", "qualifier": ["responses"]}, {"entity": "Paclitaxel", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Oxidative stress and Mitotoxicity", "qualifier": ["evidence"]}]}

To date, there is no medicine that prevents CINP in cancer patients and survivors. We determined whether blockers of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway prevent CINP. Neuropathic pain was induced by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (PAC) on four alternate days in male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Axin2-LacZ knock-in mice. XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin blockers, were administered intraperitoneally as a single or multiple doses before or after injury. Mechanical allodynia, phosphoproteome profiling, Wnt ligands, and inflammatory mediators were measured by von Frey filament, phosphoproteomics, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. Localization of \u03b2-catenin was determined by immunohistochemical analysis in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) in rats and human. Our phosphoproteome profiling of CINP rats revealed significant phosphorylation changes in Wnt signaling components. Importantly, repeated systemic injections of XAV-939 or LGK-974 prevented the development of CINP in rats. In addition, XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14 ameliorated CINP. PAC increased Wnt3a and Wnt10a, activated \u03b2-catenin in DRG, and increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 in DRG. PAC also upregulated rAxin2 in mice. Furthermore, \u03b2-catenin was expressed in neurons, including calcitonin gene-related protein-expressing neurons and satellite cells in rat and human DRG. In conclusion, chemotherapy increases Wnt3a, Wnt10a, and \u03b2-catenin in DRG and their pharmacological blockers prevent and ameliorate CINP, suggesting a target for the prevention and treatment of CINP.", "abstract_id": 33128175, "entities": [{"entity": "Chemotherapy", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CINP", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Paclitaxel (PAC)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Wnt3a, Wnt10a, and \u03b2-Catenin", "qualifier": ["in DRG"]}, {"entity": "XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CINP", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "\u03b2-Catenin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "neurons and satellite cells in DRG", "qualifier": null}]}

Of particular concern is the prevalence of opioid use among emerging adults (ages 18-25), as this is a developmental period of heightened vulnerability and critical social, neurological, and psychological development. Data from 2015 show that American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have the highest rates of diagnosis for opioid use disorders (OUDs). One recent study found that the overdose death rate among urban-dwelling AI/AN individuals was 1.4 times higher compared to those living in rural areas. To date, there are no evidence-based prevention programs addressing opioid use among urban AI/AN emerging adults that integrate culturally-appropriate strategies with evidence-based treatment. Traditions and Connections for Urban Native Americans (TACUNA) builds on our prior work with AI/AN communities across California to develop and evaluate culturally appropriate programming to address opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use among urban AI/AN emerging adults. In a randomized controlled trial, 18-25\u00a0year old urban AI/AN emerging adults will receive either TACUNA (n\u2009=\u2009185), which comprises three virtual workshops utilizing motivational interviewing, social network visualization, and integrating traditional practices and a wellness circle, or one virtual culturally sensitive opioid education workshop (n\u2009=\u2009185).

The quantity of opioid prescribed had the strongest association with patient-reported opioid consumption, with patients using 0.53 more pills (95% CI, 0.40-0.65; P\u2009<\u2009.001) for every additional pill prescribed. Patient-reported pain in the week after surgery was also significantly associated with consumption but not as strongly as prescription size. Compared with patients reporting no pain, patients used a mean (SD) 9 (1) more pills if they reported moderate pain and 16 (2) more pills if they reported severe pain (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Other significant risk factors included history of tobacco use, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, age, procedure type, and inpatient surgery status. After adjusting for these risk factors, patients in the lowest quintile of opioid prescribing had significantly lower mean (SD) opioid consumption compared with those in the highest quintile (5 [2] pills vs 37 [3] pills; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The quantity of opioid prescribed is associated with higher patient-reported opioid consumption.

{"title": "Association of State Opioid Duration Limits With Postoperative Opioid Prescribing.", "abstract": "Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published opioid prescribing guidelines in March 2016, 31 states have implemented legislation to restrict the duration of opioid prescriptions for acute pain.

To examine the association of opioid prescribing duration limits with postoperative opioid prescribing in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the first 2 states to implement limits after March 2016. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined immediate level and slope changes in monthly outcomes after prescribing limit implementation in Massachusetts and Connecticut. These states implemented 7-day limits on initial opioid prescriptions on March 14, 2016, and July 1, 2016, respectively. Using the 2014 to 2017 IBM MarketScan Research Database, 16\u202f281 opioid-naive adults in these states who filled a prescription within 3 days of surgery between July 1, 2014, and November 30, 2017, were identified. Data were analyzed from December 2018 to June 2019. The primary outcome was the prescription size in oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) for the initial postoperative opioid prescription (one 5/325 mg hydrocodone-acetaminophen pill\u2009=\u20095 OMEs). Secondary outcomes included days supplied in the initial prescription and the proportion of initial prescriptions exceeding a 7-day supply. In total, 16\u202f281 opioid-naive patients (9708 [59.6%] female; median [interquartile range] age range, 45-54 [35-44 to 55-64] years) undergoing surgical procedures were included. In Massachusetts, there were 5340 and 5435 patients in the preimplementation and postimplementation periods, respectively. In Connecticut, there were 2869 and 2637 patients in the preimplementation and postimplementation periods, respectively. Limit implementation in Massachusetts was associated with an immediate mean level decrease in prescription size (-38 OMEs [95% CI, -44 to -32 OMEs]) and with a mean decrease in slope (-1.5 OMEs/mo [95% CI, -2.1 to -0.9 OMEs/mo]). Implementation was also associated with an immediate mean level decrease in days supplied (-0.4 days [95% CI, -0.6 to -0.2 days]) and the proportion of prescriptions exceeding a 7-day supply (-5.9 percentage points [95% CI, -7.9 to -3.9 percentage points]). In contrast, limit implementation in Connecticut was not associated with level or slope changes in any outcome. Opioid prescribing duration limits had a variable association with postoperative opioid prescribing in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The mean opioid prescription size filled, days supplied, and prescribing exceeding a 7-day supply decreased after limit implementation in Massachusetts only.

Over 10 million people each year are prescribed opioids for chronic pain. There is little evidence regarding coordination of opioid management and best practices for patients on long-term opioid therapy patients following surgery. The study design is a retrospective cohort study. We identified 5749 commercially insured patients aged 18 to 64 with chronic opioid use who underwent elective surgery between January 2008 and March 2015. The predictors were presence of a UP and early return (<30 d from surgery) to a UP. The primary outcome was new high-risk opioid prescribing in the 90-day postoperative period (multiple prescribers, overlapping opioid and/or benzodiazepine prescriptions, new long acting opioid prescriptions, or new dose escalations to > 100\u200amg OME). In this cohort, 73.8% of patients were exposed to high risk prescribing postoperatively. Overall, 10% of patients did not have a UP preoperatively, and were more likely to have prescriptions from multiple prescribers (OR 2.23 95% CI 1.75-2.83) and new long acting opioid prescriptions (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.05-2.71). Among patients with a UP, earlier return was associated with decreased odds of receiving prescriptions from multiple prescribers (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.95).

{"title": "Assessing the Relative Effectiveness of Combining Self-Care with Practitioner-Delivered Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies to Improve Pain in a Pragmatic Trial.", "abstract": "Many health care systems are beginning to encourage patients to use complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies for pain management. Many clinicians have anecdotally reported that patients combining self-care CIH therapies with practitioner-delivered therapies report larger health improvements than do patients using practitioner-delivered or self-care CIH therapies alone. However, we are unaware of any trials in this area. The APPROACH Study (Assessing Pain, Patient-Reported Outcomes and Complementary and Integrative Health) assesses the value of veterans participating in practitioner-delivered CIH therapies alone or self-care CIH therapies alone compared with the combination of self-care and practitioner-delivered care. The study is being conducted in 18 Veterans Health Administration sites that received funding as part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to expand availability of CIH therapies. Practitioner-delivered therapies under study include chiropractic care, acupuncture, and therapeutic massage, and self-care therapies include tai chi/qi gong, yoga, and meditation. The primary outcome will be improvement on the Brief Pain Inventory 6\u2009months after initiation of CIH as compared with baseline scores. Patients will enter treatment groups on the basis of the care they receive because randomizing patients to specific CIH therapies would require withholding therapies routinely offered at VA. We will address selection bias and confounding by using sites' variations in business practices and other encouragements to receive different types of CIH therapies as a surrogate for direct randomization by using instrumental variable econometrics methods.

This study assesses the prevalence of co-occurring substance use in West Virginia (WV) to inform treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of, and demographic and clinical characteristics (including age, gender, hepatitis C virus (HCV) status) associated with, co-occurring substance use among patients with OUD in WV. This retrospective study utilized the West Virginia Clinical and Translation Science Institute Integrated Data Repository, comprised of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from West Virginia University Medicine. Deidentified data were extracted from inpatient psychiatric admissions and emergency department (ED) healthcare encounters between 2009 and 2018. Eligible patients were those with OUD who had a positive urine toxicology screen for opioids at the time of their initial encounter with the healthcare system. Extracted data included results of comprehensive urine toxicology testing during the study timeframe. 3,127 patients met the inclusion criteria of whom 72.8% had co-occurring substance use. Of those who were positive for opioids and at least one additional substance, benzodiazepines were the most common co-occurring substances (57.4% of patients yielded a positive urine toxicology screen for both substances), followed by cannabis (53.1%), cocaine (24.5%) and amphetamine (21.6%). Individuals who used co-occurring substances were younger than those who were positive for opioids alone (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There was a higher prevalence of individuals who used co-occurring substances that were HCV positive in comparison to those who used opioids alone (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There were limited gender differences noted between individuals who used co-occurring substances and those who used opioids alone. Among ED admissions who were positive for opioids, 264 were diagnosed with substance toxicity/overdose, 78.4% of whom had co-occurring substance use (benzodiazepines: 65.2%; cannabis: 44.4%; cocaine: 28.5%; amphetamine: 15.5%). Across the 10-year timespan, the greatest increase for the entire sample was in the rate of co-occurring amphetamine and opioid use (from 12.6% in 2014 to 47.8% in 2018).

{"title": "A Qualitative Study of Patient Protection against Postoperative Opioid Addiction: A Thematic Analysis of Self-Agency.", "abstract": "Opioids are commonly used following outpatient surgery. However, we understand little about patients' perspectives and how patients decide on postoperative opioid use. This study seeks to investigate aspects of patients' thought processes that most impact their decisions. The authors conducted semistructured interviews with 30 adults undergoing minor elective hand surgery at one tertiary hospital. Narratives were content-coded to arrive at the authors' thematic analysis. The authors incorporated Bandura's concept of self-agency to interpret the data and develop a conceptual framework that best explained the implicit theory within participants' responses. The authors found six themes under two domains of self-agency. Participants actively sought out protective mechanisms supporting their decision on opioid use, but sometimes did so unconsciously. They would avoid opioids postoperatively because they were \"tough\" and wanted to evade the risk of addiction as \"good citizens.\" They conveyed a nuanced safety against addiction because they were \"not the kind\" to become addicted and because they trusted the surgeons' prescribing. However, participants felt discouraged by the stigma associated with opioids. Both intentionally and unintentionally, participants integrated a strong sense of self in their decision-making processes. A robust understanding of how patients choose to take opioids for postoperative pain control is imperative to develop patient-centered strategies to treat the opioid epidemic. Effective opioid-reduction policies should consider patients as active agents who negotiate various internal and external influences in their decision-making processes. Surgeons must incorporate patients' individual goals and perspectives regarding postoperative opioid use to minimize opioid-related harm after surgery.", "abstract_id": 33890894, "entities": []}

This qualitative study explores how adolescents manage pain, including how decision making with parents and providers affect their experience with opioid and non-opioid analgesics after third molar dental extractions. We used a qualitative approach for the analysis of 30 telephone-based semi-structured interviews completed by 15 dyads between May and August 2019, which included 15 adolescents (15-17\u00a0years) who underwent a dental extraction, and a parent or guardian for each adolescent. The total sample included 30 participants. Interviews were conducted separately for patients and parents. De-identified interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative analysis software using a directed content analysis approach. A total of 15 patient/parent dyads were interviewed. Key themes associated with pain management included sources of information, pain management behaviors engaged in by the adolescents and their caregivers, and the use of medication. In addition to conversations with their dental provider, most patients and their parents discussed pain management plans that included non-medication options, over-the-counter medications, and opioid medications to be taken as needed, which guided their post-extraction behaviors. All participants reported that the adolescent received an opioid prescription for post-extraction pain management, to be taken on an \"as needed\" basis, but most only took it the day of the extraction and up to 2\u00a0days following, usually based on the patient's reported pain levels and perceptions of over-the-counter medication adequacy. Participants said they did not receive guidance from their provider concerning disposal of unused opioid medications. Involving adolescents in the pain management decision making process and allowing them to carry out the plan with some caregiver support was acceptable and well executed following third molar extractions. Providers may have an opportunity to reduce the number of opioids prescribed, since respondents reported little to no use of opioids that they were prescribed.

{"title": "Regulation of lipid rafts, angiogenesis and inflammation by AIBP.", "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate an important role of the secreted apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AIBP) in regulation of cholesterol efflux and lipid rafts. The article discusses these findings in the context of angiogenesis and inflammation. Lipid rafts are cholesterol-rich and sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains in which many receptor complexes assemble upon activation. AIBP mediates selective cholesterol efflux, in part via binding to toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in activated macrophages and microglia, and thus reverses lipid raft increases in activated cells. Recent articles report AIBP regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, Notch1 and TLR4 function. In zebrafish and mouse animal models, AIBP deficiency results in accelerated angiogenesis, increased inflammation and exacerbated atherosclerosis. Spinal delivery of recombinant AIBP reduces neuraxial inflammation and reverses persistent pain state in a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy.

{"title": "TRESK K", "abstract": "Although TWIK-related spinal cord K+ (TRESK) channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), whether TRESK activity regulates trigeminal pain processing is still not established. Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knock-out mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4-). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4- dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4+). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knock-out mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors, whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knock-out DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, likely through controlling the intrinsic excitability of TG nociceptors.

Using unbiased receptomics, transcriptomic analyses, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization, we found that the expression of the orphan GPCR Gpr160 and GPR160 increased in the rodent dorsal horn of the spinal cord following traumatic nerve injury. Genetic and immunopharmacological approaches demonstrated that GPR160 inhibition in the spinal cord prevented and reversed neuropathic pain in male and female rodents without altering normal pain response. GPR160 inhibition in the spinal cord attenuated sensory processing in the thalamus, a key relay in the sensory discriminative pathways of pain. We also identified cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CARTp) as a GPR160 ligand. Inhibiting endogenous CARTp signaling in spinal cord attenuated neuropathic pain, whereas exogenous intrathecal CARTp evoked painful hypersensitivity through GPR160-dependent ERK and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Our findings de-orphanize GPR160, identify it as a determinant of neuropathic pain and potential therapeutic target, and provide insights into its signaling pathways.

{"title": "SIRT1 Decreases Emotional Pain Vulnerability with Associated CaMKII\u03b1 Deacetylation in Central Amygdala.", "abstract": "Emotional disorders are common comorbid conditions that further exacerbate the severity and chronicity of chronic pain. However, individuals show considerable vulnerability to the development of chronic pain under similar pain conditions. In this study on male rat and mouse models of chronic neuropathic pain, we identify the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in central amygdala as a key epigenetic regulator that controls the development of comorbid emotional disorders underlying the individual vulnerability to chronic pain. We found that animals that were vulnerable to developing behaviors of anxiety and depression under the pain condition displayed reduced SIRT1 protein levels in central amygdala, but not those animals resistant to the emotional disorders. Viral overexpression of local SIRT1 reversed this vulnerability, but viral knockdown of local SIRT1 mimicked the pain effect, eliciting the pain vulnerability in pain-free animals. The SIRT1 action was associated with CaMKII\u03b1 downregulation and deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 at the CaMKII\u03b1 promoter. These results suggest that, by transcriptional repression of CaMKII\u03b1 in central amygdala, SIRT1 functions to guard against the emotional pain vulnerability under chronic pain conditions. This study indicates that SIRT1 may serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for individualized treatment of chronic pain with vulnerable emotional disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Chronic pain is a prevalent neurological disease with no effective treatment at present. Pain patients display considerably variable vulnerability to developing chronic pain, indicating individual-based molecular mechanisms underlying the pain vulnerability, which is hardly addressed in current preclinical research. In this study, we have identified the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as a key regulator that controls this pain vulnerability. This study reveals that the SIRT1-CaMKIIa\u03b1 pathway in central amygdala acts as an epigenetic mechanism that guards against the development of comorbid emotional disorders under chronic pain, and that its dysfunction causes increased vulnerability to the development of chronic pain. These findings suggest that SIRT1 activators may be used in a novel therapeutic approach for individual-based treatment of chronic pain.", "abstract_id": 32005763, "entities": [{"entity": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Central amygdala", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Chronic neuropathic pain", "qualifier": ["associated with emotional disorders"]}, {"entity": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CaMKII\u03b1", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Emotional disorders", "qualifier": ["anxiety", "depression"]}]}
{"title": "The Operant Plantar Thermal Assay: A Novel Device for Assessing Thermal Pain Tolerance in Mice.", "abstract": "Pain is a multidimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the operant plantar thermal assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task requiring evaluation and active decision-making to obtain reward under thermally aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures, male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA. Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition, compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of using the OPTA to assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.", "abstract_id": 32071073, "entities": [{"entity": "Operant Plantar Thermal Assay (OPTA)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Thermal Pain Tolerance", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Female Mice", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Thermal Pain Tolerance", "qualifier": ["greater temperature-dependent tolerance"]}, {"entity": "Sucrose Solution", "qualifier": ["4% vs 10%"]}, {"entity": "Thermal Pain Tolerance", "qualifier": ["increased in males"]}, {"entity": "Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Thermal Pain Tolerance", "qualifier": ["increased"]}, {"entity": "Clonidine", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Thermal Pain Tolerance", "qualifier": ["increased"]}, {"entity": "Meloxicam", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Thermal Pain Tolerance", "qualifier": ["reduced"]}]}

However, the time course of induction of this immune response and the demonstration of germinal center formation in lymphoid organs has not been evaluated.

{"title": "Dimethyl Fumarate Reduces Oxidative Stress and Pronociceptive Immune Responses in a Murine Model of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.", "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a highly disabling cause of pain often precipitated by surgery or trauma to a limb. Both innate and adaptive immunological changes contribute to this syndrome. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) works through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor and other targets to activate antioxidant systems and to suppress immune system activation. We hypothesized that DMF would reduce nociceptive, functional, and immunological changes measured in a model of CRPS. Male C57BL/6 mice were used in the well-characterized tibial fracture model of CRPS. Some groups of mice received DMF 25 mg/kg/d orally, per os for 3 weeks after fracture versus vehicle alone. Homozygous Nrf2 null mutant mice were used as test subjects to address the need for this transcription factor for DMF activity. Allodynia was assessed using von Frey filaments and hindlimb weight-bearing data were collected. The markers of oxidative stress malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were quantified in the skin of the fractured mice using immunoassays along with the innate immune system cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. The accumulation of IgM in the fractured limbs and lymph node hypertrophy were used as indexes of adaptive immune system activation, and the passive transfer of serum from wildtype fractured mice to B cell-deficient fractured muMT mice (mice lacking B cells and immunoglobulin) helped to assess the pronociceptive activity of humoral factors. We observed that oral DMF administration strongly prevented nociceptive sensitization and reduced uneven hindlimb weight bearing after fracture. DMF was also very effective in reducing the accumulation of markers of oxidative stress, activation of innate immune mediator production, lymph node hypertrophy, and the accumulation of IgM in fractured limbs. The sera of fractured vehicle-treated but not DMF-treated mice conferred pronociceptive activity to recipient mice. Unexpectedly, the effects of DMF were largely unchanged in the Nrf2 null mutant mice. Oxidative stress and immune system activation are robust after hindlimb fracture in mice. DMF strongly reduces activation of those systems, and the Nrf2 transcription factor is not required. DMF or drugs working through similar mechanisms might provide effective therapy for CRPS or other conditions where oxidative stress causes immune system activation.", "abstract_id": 33646995, "entities": [{"entity": "Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "DMF", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Oxidative stress", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "DMF", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Innate immune system", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "DMF", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Nrf2", "qualifier": null}]}

Previous studies indicate that the immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells modulate the magnitude of punctate mechanical allodynia resulting from sciatic nerve injury. However, whether enhancing Treg-mediated suppression attenuates dynamic allodynia is not known. In the present study, we addressed this knowledge gap by treating mice with low-dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL2) injections or adoptive transfer of Treg cells. Female Swiss Webster mice received daily injections of ld-IL2 (1 \u03bcg/mouse, intraperitoneally) either before or after unilateral spared nerve injury (SNI). Male C57BL/6J mice received adoptive transfer of 1 x 106 Treg cells 3 weeks post-SNI. The responses to punctate and dynamic mechanical stimuli on the hindpaw were monitored before and up to 4-6 weeks post-SNI. We also compared the distribution of Treg cells and CD3+ total T cells after SNI and/or ld-IL2 treatment. Ld-IL2 pretreatment in female Swiss Webster mice completely blocked the development of SNI-induced dynamic mechanical allodynia and reduced the magnitude of punctate allodynia. Delayed ld-IL2 treatment in female mice significantly attenuated the morphine-resistant punctate and dynamic allodynia at 3-5 weeks post-SNI. Adoptive transfer of Treg cells to male C57BL/6J mice 3 weeks post-SNI effectively reversed the persistent punctate and dynamic allodynia, supporting that the effect of ld-IL2 is mediated through endogenous Treg cells, and is likely independent of mouse strain and sex. Neither ld-IL2 treatment nor Treg transfer affected the basal responses to punctate or brush stimuli. Ld-IL2 significantly increased the frequency of Treg cells among total CD3+ T cells in the injured sciatic nerves but not in the uninjured nerves or the dorsal root ganglia, suggesting the injured nerve as ld-IL2's site of action.

In this study, we examined the effect of a localized \"microsympathectomy,\" ie, cutting the gray rami containing sympathetic postganglionic axons where they enter the L4 and L5 spinal nerves, which is more analogous to clinically used sympathetic blockade compared with chemical or surgical sympathectomy. We also examined manipulations of CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), a key player in both regeneration and pain. We used rat tibial nerve crush as a neuropathic pain model in which peripheral nerve regeneration can occur successfully. CCL2 in the sensory ganglia was increased by tibial nerve crush and reduced by microsympathectomy. Microsympathectomy and localized siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCL2 in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion had very similar effects: partial improvement of mechanical hypersensitivity and guarding behavior, reduction of regeneration markers growth-associated protein 43 and activating transcription factor 3, and reduction of macrophage density in the sensory ganglia and regenerating nerve. Microsympathectomy reduced functional regeneration as measured by myelinated action potential propagation through the injury site and denervation-induced atrophy of the tibial-innervated gastrocnemius muscle at day 10.

{"title": "Duration of Reduction in Enduring Stress-Induced Hyperalgesia Via FKBP51 Inhibition Depends on Timing of Administration Relative to Traumatic Stress Exposure.", "abstract": "Chronic pain development is a frequent outcome of severe stressor exposure, with or without tissue injury. Enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH) is believed to play a central role, but the precise mechanisms mediating the development of chronic post-traumatic pain, and the time-dependency of these mechanisms, remain poorly understood. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), a key stress system regulator, might prevent ESIH. We evaluated whether peritraumatic inhibition of FKBP51 in an animal model of traumatic stress exposure, the single prolonged stress (SPS) model, reversed ESIH evaluated via daily mechanical von Frey testing. FKBP51 inhibition was achieved using SAFit2, a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of FKBP51, administered to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats via intraperitoneal injection. To assess timing effects, FKBP51 was administered at different times relative to stress (SPS) exposure. SAFit2 administration immediately after SPS produced a complete reversal in ESIH lasting >7 days. In contrast, SAFit2 administration 72 hours following SPS produced only temporary hyperalgesia reversal, and administration 120h following SPS had no effect. Similarly, animals undergoing SPS together with tissue injury (plantar incision) receiving SAFit2 immediately post-surgery developed acute hyperalgesia but recovered by 4 days and did not develop ESIH. These data suggest that: 1) FKBP51 plays an important, time-dependent role in ESIH pathogenesis, 2) time windows of opportunity may exist to prevent ESIH via FKBP51 inhibition after traumatic stress, with or without tissue injury, and 3) the use of inhibitors of specific pathways may provide new insights into chronic post-traumatic pain development. PERSPECTIVE: The current work adds to a growing body of literature indicating that FKBP51 inhibition is a highly promising potential treatment strategy for reducing hyperalgesia.

Despite clinical evidence linking pain, stress, and cancer progression, the underlying relationship between pain and sympathetic neurotransmission in oral cancer is unknown. We found that human HNSCC tumors and mouse tumor tissue are innervated by peripheral sympathetic and sensory nerves. Moreover, \u03b2-adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors (\u03b2-ARs) are overexpressed in human oral cancer cell lines, and norepinephrine treatment increased \u03b2-AR2 protein expression as well as cancer cell proliferation in vitro. We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) signaling reduces oral cancer-induced nociceptive behavior. Norepinephrine-treated cancer cell lines secrete more TNF\u03b1 which, when applied to tongue-innervating trigeminal neurons, evoked a larger Ca 2+ transient; TNF-TNFR inhibitor blocked the increase in the evoked Ca 2+ transient. Using an orthotopic xenograft oral cancer model, we found that mice demonstrated significantly less orofacial cancer-induced nociceptive behavior during systemic \u03b2-adrenergic inhibitory treatment with propranolol. Furthermore, chemical sympathectomy using guanethidine led to a significant reduction in tumor size and nociceptive behavior. We infer from these results that sympathetic signaling modulates oral cancer pain through TNF\u03b1 secretion and tumorigenesis.

Emerging evidence supports the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating gene transcription. Here we identified a conserved lncRNA, named nerve injury-specific lncRNA (NIS-lncRNA) for its upregulation in injured DRGs exclusively in response to nerve injury. This upregulation was triggered by nerve injury-induced increase in DRG ELF1, a transcription factor that bound to the NIS-lncRNA promoter. Blocking this upregulation attenuated nerve injury-induced CCL2 increase in injured DRGs and nociceptive hypersensitivity during the development and maintenance periods of neuropathic pain. Mimicking NIS-lncRNA upregulation elevated CCL2 expression, increased CCL2-mediated excitability in DRG neurons, and produced neuropathic pain symptoms. Mechanistically, NIS-lncRNA recruited more binding of the RNA-interacting protein FUS to the Ccl2 promoter and augmented Ccl2 transcription in injured DRGs. Thus, NIS-lncRNA participates in neuropathic pain likely by promoting FUS-triggered DRG Ccl2 expression and may be a potential target in neuropathic pain management.", "abstract_id": 35775484, "entities": [{"entity": "NIS-lncRNA", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Ccl2", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NIS-lncRNA", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Neuropathic pain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "ELF1", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NIS-lncRNA", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NIS-lncRNA", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "RNA-interacting protein FUS", "qualifier": null}]}

To facilitate the adoption and implementation of innovative treatments, attention must be paid to how SUD treatment workforce issues affect the implementation of clinical effectiveness research. Multiple variables have been shown to relate to turnover, yet reasons that are specific to conducting research have not been systematically assessed. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial testing a sexual risk reduction counselor training intervention, 69 counselors at 4 outpatient SUD treatment sites (2 opioid treatment programs [OTPs], 2 psychosocial) were enrolled and randomized to 1 of 2 training conditions (Standard vs. Enhanced). Study counselor and agency turnover rates were calculated. Agency context and policies that impacted research participation were examined. Results: Study turnover rates for enrolled counselors were substantial, ranging from 33% to 74% over approximately a 2-year active study period. Study counselor turnover was significantly greater at outpatient psychosocial programs versus OTPs. Counselor turnover did not differ due to demographic or training condition assignment. Leaving agency employment was the most typical reason for study counselor turnover.

The current study examined correlates of opioid abstinence over time after completion of a treatment trial for prescription opioid dependence. The multisite Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study examined different durations of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment and different intensities of counseling to treat prescription opioid dependence, as assessed by DSM-IV; following the clinical trial, a longitudinal study was conducted from March 2009-January 2013.

Dispensing naloxone and medications for OUD and counseling patients about these medications are ways pharmacists can provide care. Key to pharmacists' involvement is their willingness to take on these practice responsibilities. Methods: The purpose of this scoping review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize published literature describing pharmacists' attitudes toward naloxone and medications for OUD, i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. All searches were performed on December 7, 2018, in 5 databases: Embase.com, PubMed.gov, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Wiley, and Clarivate Web of Science. Articles included original research conducted in the United States, described attitude-related language toward naloxone and medications for OUD, and pharmacists. Results: A total of 1323 articles were retrieved, 7 were included. Five studies reported on pharmacists' attitudes toward naloxone dispensing, 1 study reported on attitudes toward naloxone, buprenorphine, and buprenorphine/naloxone, and 1 reported on attitudes toward buprenorphine/naloxone. Respondents were diverse, including pharmacists from different practice specialties. Studies found that pharmacists agreed with a naloxone standing order, believed that naloxone should be dispensed to individuals at risk of an opioid overdose, and were supportive of dispensing buprenorphine. A minority of pharmacists expressed negative attitudes. Barriers cited to implementation included education and training, workflow, and management support.

Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between the sources of misused POs and past-year POUD. All analyses were stratified by age groups for each sex. Results: Overall, the most common sources of misused POs were obtaining from friends/relatives for free (40.27%) and physicians (36.59%). Males had a higher prevalence of buying POs from friends/relatives or drug dealers/strangers than females. Significant age differences also emerged. Buying POs from drug dealers/strangers (vs. obtaining POs free from friends/relatives) was strong predictor of past-year POUD in both sexes.

We evaluated how the presence of a history of depression influences opioid use outcome (negative urine drug assays). Using adjusted logistic regression models, we tested the hypotheses that 1) a reduction in depressive symptoms and 2) greater motivation and engagement in treatment account for the association between depression history and good treatment outcome. Although depressive symptoms decreased significantly throughout treatment (p <.001), this improvement was not associated with opioid outcomes (aOR = 0.98, ns). Reporting a goal of opioid abstinence at treatment entry was also not associated with outcomes (aOR = 1.39, ns); however, mutual-help group participation was associated with good treatment outcomes (aOR = 1.67, p <.05). In each of these models, lifetime major depressive disorder remained associated with good outcomes (aORs = 1.63-1.82, ps = .01-.055).

Results: Among the total sample, the prevalence of any past 3-month use was 53.9% for alcohol, 42.0% for tobacco, 24.2% for any illicit/Rx drug, and 5.3% for opioids; the prevalence of ASSIST-defined moderate/high-risk use was 45.1% for tobacco, 29.0% for any illicit/Rx drug, 14.2% for alcohol, and 9.1% for opioids. Differences in the extent and risk-levels of substance use by sex, race/ethnicity, and age group were observed. Adjusted logistic regression showed that male sex, white race, not being married, and having less education were associated with increased odds of moderate/high-risk use scores for each substance category; older ages (versus ages 18-25\u2009years) were associated with increased odds of moderate/high-risk opioid use. Conclusions: Intervention need for problematic substance use was prevalent in this sample. Providers should maintain awareness and screen for problematic substance use more consistently in identified high risk populations.", "abstract_id": 33797348, "entities": [{"entity": "Alcohol", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Patients", "qualifier": ["past 3-month use"]}, {"entity": "Tobacco", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Patients", "qualifier": ["past 3-month use"]}, {"entity": "Illicit/Rx drug", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Patients", "qualifier": ["past 3-month use"]}, {"entity": "Opioids", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Patients", "qualifier": ["past 3-month use"]}, {"entity": "Male sex", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Moderate/high-risk use scores", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "White race", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Moderate/high-risk use scores", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Not being married", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Moderate/high-risk use scores", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Less education", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Moderate/high-risk use scores", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Older ages", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Moderate/high-risk opioid use", "qualifier": null}]}

Participants of 2 randomized controlled trials (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care [EMBARC; n\u2009=\u2009251 with DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder; study duration: August 2011-December 2015] and STimulant Reduction Intervention Using Dosed Exercise [STRIDE; n\u2009=\u2009302 with DSM-IV diagnosis of stimulant abuse or dependence; study-duration: July 2010-February 2013]) and treatment-seeking patients in primary care clinics from an ongoing quality-improvement project (VitalSign6; n\u2009=\u20094,370; project duration: August 2014-July 2019) were included. Psychometric properties of the P-FIBS were evaluated with confirmatory factor and item response theory analyses in EMBARC and VitalSign6. The approach of Baron and Kenny was used to assess whether irritability accounted for the effect of pain on depression. Cronbach \u03b1 (0.84-0.89) and model fits for single-factor structure of P-FIBS were acceptable. Pain was positively correlated with irritability (r\u2009=\u20090.22-0.29) and depression (r\u2009=\u20090.10-0.33). Irritability accounted for 40.7%-65.5% of the effect of pain on depression. Higher irritability and depression were associated with poorer social functioning, quality of life, and productivity in work- and non-work-related activities. Pain was associated with non-work-related activity impairments even after controlling for irritability and depression. The P-FIBS is a brief and reliable measure of pain. Irritability is associated with pain and accounts for a large proportion of the effect of pain on depression.

{"title": "Comparison of Methods for Alcohol and Drug Screening in Primary Care Clinics.", "abstract": "Guidelines recommend that adult patients receive screening for alcohol and drug use during primary care visits, but the adoption of screening in routine practice remains low. Clinics frequently struggle to choose a screening approach that is best suited to their resources, workflows, and patient populations. To evaluate how to best implement electronic health record (EHR)-integrated screening for substance use by comparing commonly used screening methods and examining their association with implementation outcomes. This article presents the outcomes of phases 3 and 4 of a 4-phase quality improvement, implementation feasibility study in which researchers worked with stakeholders at 6 primary care clinics in 2 large urban academic health care systems to define and implement their optimal screening approach. Site A was located in New York City and comprised 2 clinics, and site B was located in Boston, Massachusetts, and comprised 4 clinics. Clinics initiated screening between January 2017 and October 2018, and 93\u202f114 patients were eligible for screening for alcohol and drug use. Data used in the analysis were collected between January 2017 and October 2019, and analysis was performed from July 13, 2018, to March 23, 2021. Clinics integrated validated screening questions and a brief counseling script into the EHR, with implementation supported by the use of clinical champions (ie, clinicians who advocate for change, motivate others, and use their expertise to facilitate the adoption of an intervention) and the training of clinic staff. Clinics varied in their screening approaches, including the type of visit targeted for screening (any visit vs annual examinations only), the mode of administration (staff-administered vs self-administered by the patient), and the extent to which they used practice facilitation and EHR usability testing. Data from the EHRs were extracted quarterly for 12 months to measure implementation outcomes. The primary outcome was screening rate for alcohol and drug use. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol and drug use detected via screening, and clinician adoption of a brief counseling script. Patients of the 6 clinics had a mean (SD) age ranging from 48.9 (17.3) years at clinic B2 to 59.1 (16.7) years at clinic B3, were predominantly female (52.4% at clinic A1 to 64.6% at clinic A2), and were English speaking. Racial diversity varied by location. Of the 93,114 patients with primary care visits, 71.8% received screening for alcohol use, and 70.5% received screening for drug use. Screening at any visit (implemented at site A) in comparison with screening at annual examinations only (implemented at site B) was associated with higher screening rates for alcohol use (90.3%-94.7% vs 24.2%-72.0%, respectively) and drug use (89.6%-93.9% vs 24.6%-69.8%). The 5 clinics that used a self-administered screening approach had a higher detection rate for moderate- to high-risk alcohol use (14.7%-36.6%) compared with the 1 clinic that used a staff-administered screening approach (1.6%). The detection of moderate- to high-risk drug use was low across all clinics (0.5%-1.0%). Clinics with more robust practice facilitation and EHR usability testing had somewhat greater adoption of the counseling script for patients with moderate-high risk alcohol or drug use (1.4%-12.5% vs 0.1%-1.1%). In this quality improvement study, EHR-integrated screening was feasible to implement in all clinics and unhealthy alcohol use was detected more frequently when self-administered screening was used at any primary care visit. The detection of drug use was low at all clinics, as was clinician adoption of counseling. These findings can be used to inform the decision-making of health care systems that are seeking to implement screening for substance use.

However, the extent to which the in vivo effects of mitragynine are mediated by opioid receptors, or whether mitragynine interacts with other opioid agonists, is not fully established. The effects of mitragynine and the prototypical opioid agonist morphine were compared for their capacity to decrease operant responding for food delivery, and to increase response latency to a thermal stimulus. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats responded under a multiple cycle fixed ratio 10 schedule of food delivery and were tested on a hot plate (52\u00a0\u00b0C) immediately after each cycle. Morphine and mitragynine were administered alone, in combination with each other, and in combination with the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Morphine and mitragynine dose-dependently decreased schedule-controlled responding; the ED50 values were 7.3 and 31.5\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. Both drugs increased thermal antinociception; the ED50 value for morphine was 18.3. Further, doses of naltrexone that antagonized morphine did not antagonize mitragynine.

The antinociceptive effects of mitragynine and morphine occur at doses larger than those that disrupt learned behavior.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potentially disruptive side effects and therapeutic potential of a novel antagonist (D24M) of the mu-/delta-opioid receptor (MOR/DOR) heterodimer in male rats. Administration of high doses of D24M (1 & 10 nmol) into the lateral ventricle did not disrupt home cage wheel running. Repeated twice daily administration of increasing doses of morphine (5-20 mg/kg) over 5 days depressed wheel running and induced antinociceptive tolerance measured with the hot plate test. Administration of D24M had no effect on morphine tolerance, but tended to prolong morphine antinociception in non-tolerant rats. Spontaneous morphine withdrawal was evident as a decrease in body weight, a reduction in wheel running and an increase in sleep during the normally active dark phase of the circadian cycle, and an increase in wheel running and wakefulness in the normally inactive light phase. Administration of D24M during the dark phase on the third day of withdrawal had no effect on wheel running. These data provide additional evidence for the clinical relevance of home cage wheel running as a method to assess spontaneous opioid withdrawal in rats. These data also demonstrate that blocking the MOR/DOR heterodimer does not produce disruptive side effects or block the antinociceptive effects of morphine.

The surgical protocol resulted in a median intravenous jugular catheter patency in male and female rats of 126 days (range: 25-365 days). Drug-vs-food choice was established with opioids (fentanyl and heroin), psychostimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine, and amphetamine), and an opioid/psychostimulant mixture (fentanyl + methamphetamine). The average time from catheter implantation to stable choice behavior across all drugs was 27 sessions (range: 16-44 sessions). Choice behavior stabilized more quickly for cocaine and fentanyl than for other drugs. Manipulations of both environmental variables (e.g., response requirement or food reinforcer magnitude) and pharmacological variables (e.g., extended access drug self-administration or continuous buprenorphine treatment via osmotic pump) significantly shifted opioid-vs-food choice consistent with previous monkey studies. Duration of intravenous catheter patency in rats was suitable for long-term, within-subject drug choice studies.

Quantifying a more comprehensive assessment of treatment outcomes could identify the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies for individuals with AUD/substance use disorders, and help patients to identify, in advance, appropriate treatment options. This study developed and embedded patient-reported outcome measures into the routine clinical operations of a residential treatment program. Surveys assessed demographics, drug use history, physical and mental health, and quality of life. Outcomes were assessed among participants at admission (n = 961) and in patients who completed the survey at time of discharge (n = 633). Past 30-day alcohol and/or opioid use at admission were correlated with worse self-reported physical and mental health, sleep, and quality of life, and greater negative affect and craving ( P s < 0.05).

Lyndra Therapeutics is developing a once-weekly long-acting oral product containing buprenorphine. We evaluated the efficacy of this formulation in reducing intravenous (i.v.) fentanyl self-administration by three male and three female rhesus monkeys. Buprenorphine HCl and naloxone HCl were co-formulated using an 11:1 ratio of buprenorphine:naloxone in a controlled-release gastric residence formulation administered in an oral capsule (LYN-013). Naloxone was included to determine the feasibility of combining naloxone with buprenorphine in the formulation as an abuse deterrent. Complete fentanyl dose-response functions were determined during each session. The efficacy of single doses of 56/5, 112/10 and 168/15\u00a0mg buprenorphine/naloxone in reducing fentanyl self-administration was examined over 13 days. LYN-013 significantly decreased the rate of responding for fentanyl for 3 days and significantly reduced total intake of fentanyl for 8 days. Time to maximal buprenorphine levels (Tmax) ranged between 56 and 68\u00a0h for all 3 doses. The maximal buprenorphine level (Cmax) following 168\u00a0mg was 2.3\u00a0ng/ml which was significantly greater that those observed for 56\u00a0mg (1.22\u00a0ng/ml) and 112\u00a0mg (1.35\u00a0ng/ml). Finally, the area-under-curves (AUCtau) were buprenorphine dose-dependently increased from 88 to 127-265\u00a0h*ng/ml. There were no signs of non-specific changes in behavior.

{"title": "Effects of 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylamphetamine (DOM) and 2-Piperazin-1-yl-Quinoline (Quipazine) on Fentanyl Versus Food Choice in Rhesus Monkeys.", "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in the potential therapeutic effects of drugs with agonist properties at serotonin 2A subtype (5-HT2A) receptors (e.g., psychedelics), including treatment of substance use disorders. Studying interactions between 5-HT2A receptor agonists and other drugs is important for understanding potential therapeutic effects as well as adverse interactions. Direct-acting 5-HT2A receptor agonists such as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM) and 2-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline (quipazine) enhance some (e.g., antinociceptive) effects of opioids; however, it is unclear whether they alter the abuse-related effects of opioids. This study examined whether DOM and quipazine alter the reinforcing effects of fentanyl in rhesus monkeys (n = 6) responding under a food versus drug choice procedure. Responding on one lever delivered sucrose pellets and responding on the other lever delivered intravenous (i.v.) infusions. In one set of experiments, fentanyl (0.1-3.2 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) versus food choice sessions were preceded by noncontingent i.v. pretreatments with DOM (0032-0.32 mg/kg), quipazine (0.32-1.0 mg/kg), naltrexone (0.032 mg/kg), or heroin (0.1 mg/kg). In another set of experiments, fentanyl was available during choice sessions in combination with DOM (0.32-100 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) or quipazine (3.2-320 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) in varying dose ratios. Naltrexone decreased and heroin increased fentanyl choice, demonstrating sensitivity of responding to pharmacological manipulation. However, whether given as a pretreatment or made available in combination with fentanyl as a mixture, neither DOM nor quipazine significantly altered fentanyl choice. These results suggest that 5-HT2A receptor agonists do not enhance the reinforcing effects of opioids and, thus, will not likely enhance abuse potential. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Serotonin 2A subtype receptor agonists enhance some (e.g., antinociceptive) effects of opioids, suggesting they could be combined with opioids in some therapeutic contexts such as treating pain. However, it is unclear whether they also enhance adverse effects of opioids, including abuse. Results of this study indicate that serotonin 2A subtype receptor agonists do not reliably enhance opioid self-administration and, thus, are unlikely to enhance the abuse potential of opioids.", "abstract_id": 36272734, "entities": [{"entity": "DOM", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fentanyl choice", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Quipazine", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fentanyl choice", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Naltrexone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fentanyl choice", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Heroin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fentanyl choice", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "5-HT2A receptor agonists", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Reinforcing effects of opioids", "qualifier": null}]}

The current study aimed to investigate the extent to which prenatal substance exposure (alcohol, opioids) impacts infant self-regulation during a relational stressor and the association between self-regulation and infant affect. Participants were 100 mother-child dyads recruited prenatally (Mean\u00a0=\u00a023.8 gestational weeks) and completed the Still Face Paradigm (SFP) when infants were 5 to 8\u00a0months of age (Mean\u00a0=\u00a06.9\u00a0months) as part of an ENRICH prospective birth cohort study. Based on prospective repeated assessment of maternal substance use in pregnancy, infants were grouped into: 1) Unexposed controls; 2) Alcohol-exposed; 3) Opioid-exposed due to maternal use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) with or without other opioids; 4) MOUD and alcohol. Infant stress reactivity (negative affect) and self-regulation were assessed during the validated 5-episode SFP. Mixed effects linear models were used to analyze differences in the percent of self-regulation and percent of negative affect among the study groups across SFP episodes, as well as the group-by-self-regulation interaction with respect to infant negative affect. The MOUD+Alcohol group demonstrated significantly lower self-regulation at baseline compared to controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was a significant group-by-self-regulation interaction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028).

In this pilot study, we characterized network connectivity in opioid-exposed infants (n = 19) and controls (n = 20) between 4-8 weeks of age using both a whole-brain connectomic approach and a seed-based approach. Prenatal opioid exposure was associated with differences in distribution of betweenness centrality and connection length, with positive connections unique to each group significantly longer than common connections. The unique connections in the opioid-exposed group were more often inter-network connections while unique connections in controls and connections common to both groups were more often intra-network. The opioid-exposed group had smaller network volumes particularly in the primary visual network, but similar network strength as controls.

Currently there are no diagnostic tools to reliably predict which infants will develop severe NOWS, while risk stratification would allow for proactive decisions about appropriate clinical monitoring and interventions. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to assess if extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in umbilical cord plasma of infants with POE could predict NOWS severity.

A total of 49 infants, including 21 opioid-exposed and 28 controls, were enrolled and underwent MRI (43\u2009\u00b1\u20096 days old) after birth, including resting state functional MRI. Edge-centric functional networks based on dynamic functional connections were constructed, and machine-learning methods were employed to identify neural features distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from unexposed controls. An accuracy of 73.6% (sensitivity 76.25% and specificity 69.33%) was achieved using 10 times 10-fold cross-validation, which substantially outperformed those obtained using conventional static functional connections (accuracy 56.9%). More importantly, we identified that prenatal opioid exposure preferentially affects inter- rather than intra-network dynamic functional connections, particularly with the visual, subcortical, and default mode networks. Consistent results at the brain regional and connection levels were also observed, where the brain regions and connections associated with visual and higher order cognitive functions played pivotal roles in distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from controls. Our findings support the clinical phenotype of infants exposed to opioids in utero and may potentially explain the higher rates of visual and emotional problems observed in this population. Finally, our findings suggested that edge-centric networks could better capture the neural differences between opioid-exposed infants and controls by abstracting the intrinsic co-fluctuation along edges, which may provide a promising tool for future studies focusing on investigating the effects of prenatal opioid exposure on neurodevelopment.", "abstract_id": 35602654, "entities": [{"entity": "Infants", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "MRI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Neural features", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Prenatal opioid exposure", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Inter-network dynamic functional connections", "qualifier": ["visual, subcortical, and default mode networks"]}, {"entity": "Brain regions and connections", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Visual and higher order cognitive functions", "qualifier": null}]}

Meanwhile, interest in nonpharmacologic treatments for pain that targets coping as well as comorbid anxiety and depression has been increasing, particularly given the significant societal damage that has resulted from the opioid epidemic. Evidence-based, nonpharmacologic treatments have shown promise in treating pain in areas outside of nephrology. Currently, little is known about the effects of these treatments among adults with CKD, and particularly end-stage kidney disease, when chronic pain can become debilitating.

Although more than 200,000 hysterectomies are performed annually for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, previous studies indicate that 1 in 4 women undergo the discomfort and morbidity of hysterectomy without the relief of pain. The factors that predict treatment failure remain poorly characterized. To describe the incidence of persistent pelvic pain 6 months following hysterectomy in women with chronic pelvic pain and determine whether a simple, self-reported measure of central sensitization is associated with a greater risk of persistent pelvic pain following hysterectomy. We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of women undergoing hysterectomy at an academic tertiary care center for a benign indication. Patients with preoperative chronic pelvic pain, defined as average pelvic pain \u22653 on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale for >3 months before hysterectomy, were included in this analysis. The patients completed validated assessments of pain, anxiety, depression, and centralized pain (using the 2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Criteria, 0-31 points) preoperatively and 6 months after hysterectomy. The demographic information, surgical history, intraoperative findings, and surgical pathology were abstracted from the electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of persistent pelvic pain 6 months following hysterectomy, defined as <50% improvement in pelvic pain severity. Among 176 participants with pelvic pain before hysterectomy, 126 (71.6%) were retained at 6 months, and 15 (11.9%) reported persistent pelvic pain. There was no difference in age (P=.46), race (P=.55), average pain severity during menses (P=.68), average overall pelvic pain (P=.10), or pain duration (P=.80) in those with and without persistent pelvic pain. Whereas intraoperative findings of endometriosis (P=.05) and uterine fibroids (P=.03) were associated with a higher incidence of persistent pain on univariate analysis, the surgical route (P=.46), pelvic adhesions (0.51), uterine weight (P=.66), and adenomyosis on histopathology (P=.27) were not related to the risk of persistent pain. Higher preoperative centralized pain scores (P=.01) but not depression (P=.64) or anxiety (P=.45) were more common in women with persistent pelvic pain. Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, preoperative pain severity, anxiety, depression, and operative findings of endometriosis and fibroids indicated that every 1-point increase in centralized pain before hysterectomy was associated with a 27% increase in the odds of persistent pelvic pain (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.57) 6 months after surgery.

{"title": "Changes In Health Services Use After Receipt Of Medications For Opioid Use Disorder In A Statewide Correctional System.", "abstract": "To decrease opioid overdose mortality, prisons and jails in the US are increasingly offering medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) to incarcerated people. It is unknown how receipt of these medications in a correctional setting affects health services use after release. In this article we analyze changes in postrelease health care use after the implementation of a statewide medications for OUD program in the unified jail and prison system of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Using Medicaid claims data, we examined individual health care use in the community before and after receipt of medications for OUD while incarcerated. We found that inpatient admissions did not change, emergency department visits decreased, and both nonacute outpatient services and pharmacy claims increased after people received medications for OUD while incarcerated.

To compare opioid overdose death (OOD) rates among formerly incarcerated persons (FIPs) from 2016 to 2018 with the North Carolina population and with OOD rates from 2000 to 2015. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 259\u2009861 North Carolina FIPs from 2000 to 2018 linked with North Carolina death records. We used indirectly standardized OOD mortality rates and ratios and present 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. From 2017 to 2018, the OOD rates in the North Carolina general population decreased by 10.1% but increased by 32% among FIPs. During 2016 to 2018, the highest substance-specific OOD rate among FIPs was attributable to synthetic narcotics (mainly fentanyl and its analogs), while OOD rates for other opioids were half or less than that from synthetic narcotics. During 2016 to 2018, the OOD risk for FIPs from synthetic narcotics was 50.3 (95% CI\u2009=\u200930.9, 69.6), 20.2 (95% CI\u2009=\u200917.3, 23.2), and 18.2 (95% CI\u2009=\u200915.9, 20.5) times as high as that for the North Carolina population at 2-week, 1-year, and complete follow-up after release, respectively.

To evaluate the factor structure of the AAQ-SA, we conducted confirmatory factor analyses with the two-factor structure proposed by the original authors and the three-factor structure found in a Mexican sample. We found the two-factor structure to be a better fit of the data from our sample. After implementing modifications to the model, the two-factor structure demonstrated adequate model fit indices. To gather evidence of convergent validity, we evaluated correlations between scores of the AAQ-SA and those of depression, self-efficacy, and self-stigma measures.

The current study examines understandings and experiences of people with OUD while they have navigated these crises. The study was guided by a pragmatic lens. We conducted brief semi-structured qualitative interviews with 25 individuals in Chicago, the majority of which had received methadone treatment during the pandemic. Thematic inductive analysis was guided by primary interview questions. The sample represents a high-risk group, being composed mostly of older non-Hispanic African American males and having considerable socioeconomic barriers. Themes demonstrate how individuals are keeping safe despite limited knowledge of COVID-19, how the pandemic has increased treatment motivation for some, how adaptations impacted treatment and recovery supports, how the availability social support had been reduced, and difficulties individuals had keeping or obtaining financial support. The findings can be useful for informing future public health response to ensure appropriate treatment access and supports are available. In particular are the need for treatment providers to ensure people with OUD receive appropriate and understandable health crisis-related information and ensuring funds are appropriately allocated to address mental health impacts of social isolation.

The current study examines sexual risk and substance use among emergency department patients aged 13-24\u00a0years (n\u2009=\u2009147), who completed an automated screening as part of a tablet-based intervention designed to increase HIV testing. Twenty seven percent (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants chose to test for HIV after completing the tablet-based intervention.

Specifically, 211 veterans assessed within a chronic pain treatment service for opioid-prescribed individuals completed self-report measures of opioid misuse, alcohol misuse, pain intensity, depression, pain catastrophizing, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS). Based on the substance misuse measures, 32% (n\u00a0=\u00a068) were misusing neither opioids nor alcohol, 23% (n\u00a0=\u00a048) were misusing both opioids and alcohol, 40% (n\u00a0=\u00a084) were misusing opioids alone, and 5% (n\u00a0=\u00a011) were misusing alcohol alone. Group comparisons indicated that individuals not misusing either substance were less distressed in comparison to those who were misusing opioids alone or both substances.

{"title": "Service Needs for Corrections-Involved Parents With a History of Problematic Opioid Use: A Community Needs Assessment.", "abstract": "The incarceration of a parent is often a continuation of a challenging family situation marked by poverty, unstable housing, trauma, and abuse. These challenges make it difficult for incarcerated parents reentering their communities to raise their children effectively and, thus, increase the likelihood of poor outcomes for their children. Children whose parents are also battling opioid misuse have an even higher risk for long-term problems. This study uses survey data from 48 community service providers to better understand the service needs of parents with histories of problematic opioid use who are reentering their communities after incarceration. Community service providers recommended implementing intervention programs that cover critical information related to basic needs, supportive community resources, drug treatment programs, and parenting to help individuals thrive in their communities and meet their children's needs.

Allowing naloxone to be dispensed directly by a pharmacist without an individual prescription under a naloxone standing order (NSO) can expand access. The community-level factors associated with naloxone dispensed under NSO are unknown. Using a dataset comprised of pharmacy reports of naloxone dispensed under NSO from 70% of Massachusetts retail pharmacies, we examined relationships between community-level demographics, rurality, measures of treatment for opioid use disorder, and overdose deaths with naloxone dispensed under NSO per ZIP Code-quarter from 2014 until 2018. We used a multi-variable zero-inflated negative binomial model, assessing odds of any naloxone dispensed under NSO, as well as a multi-variable negative binomial model assessing quantities of naloxone dispensed under NSO. From 2014-2018, quantities of naloxone dispensed under NSO and the number of pharmacies dispensing any naloxone under NSO increased over time. However, communities with greater percentages of people with Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.96 per 5% increase), and rural communities compared to urban communities (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.90) were less likely to dispense any naloxone by NSO. Communities with more individuals treated with buprenorphine dispensed more naloxone under NSO, as did communities with more opioid-related overdose deaths. Naloxone dispensing has substantially increased, in part driven by standing orders.

Preclinical evidence suggests altered molecular rhythms in the brain modulate opioid reward and relapse. However, whether molecular rhythms are disrupted in the brains of people with OUD remained an open question, critical to understanding the role of circadian rhythms in opioid addiction. Using subjects' times of death as a marker of time of day, we investigated transcriptional rhythms in the brains of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected comparison subjects. We discovered rhythmic transcripts in both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), key brain areas involved in OUD, that were largely distinct between OUD and unaffected subjects. Fewer rhythmic transcripts were identified in DLPFC of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected subjects, whereas in the NAc, nearly double the number of rhythmic transcripts was identified in subjects with OUD. In NAc of subjects with OUD, rhythmic transcripts peaked either in the evening or near sunrise, and were associated with an opioid, dopamine, and GABAergic neurotransmission. Associations with altered neurotransmission in NAc were further supported by co-expression network analysis which identified OUD-specific modules enriched for transcripts involved in dopamine, GABA, and glutamatergic synaptic functions. Additionally, rhythmic transcripts in DLPFC and NAc of subjects with OUD were enriched for genomic loci associated with sleep-related GWAS traits, including sleep duration and insomnia.

{"title": "Sex-specific role of the circadian transcription factor NPAS2 in opioid tolerance, withdrawal and analgesia.", "abstract": "Opioids like fentanyl remain the mainstay treatment for chronic pain. Unfortunately, opioid's high dependence liability has led to the current opioid crisis, in part, because of side-effects that develop during long-term use, including analgesic tolerance and physical dependence. Both tolerance and dependence to opioids may lead to escalation of required doses to achieve previous therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, altered sleep and circadian rhythms are common in people on opioid therapy. Opioids impact sleep and circadian rhythms, while disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms likely mediate the effects of opioids. However, the mechanisms underlying these bidirectional relationships between circadian rhythms and opioids remain largely unknown. The circadian protein, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), regulates circadian-dependent gene transcription in structure of the central nervous system that modulate opioids and pain. Here, male and female wild-type and NPAS2-deficient (NPAS2-/-) mice were used to investigate the role of NPAS2 in fentanyl analgesia, tolerance, hyperalgesia and physical dependence. Overall, thermal pain thresholds, acute analgesia and tolerance to a fixed dose of fentanyl were largely similar between wild-type and NPAS2-/- mice. However, female NPAS2-/- exhibited augmented analgesic tolerance and significantly more behavioral symptoms of physical dependence to fentanyl. Only male NPAS2-/- mice had increased fentanyl-induced hypersensitivity, when compared with wild-type males.

Bias was assessed via testing for differences in type II error rates across racial/ethnic subgroups (Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White, Other) using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. A local surrogate model was estimated to interpret the classifier's predictions by race and averaged globally from the datasets. Subgroup analyses and post-hoc recalibrations were conducted to attempt to mitigate biased metrics. We identified bias in the false negative rate (FNR = 0.32) of the Black subgroup compared to the FNR (0.17) of the White subgroup. Top features included \"heroin\" and \"substance abuse\" across subgroups. Post-hoc recalibrations eliminated bias in FNR with minimal changes in other subgroup error metrics. The Black FNR subgroup had higher risk scores for readmission and mortality than the White FNR subgroup, and a higher mortality risk score than the Black true positive subgroup (P\u2009<\u2009.05). The Black FNR subgroup had the greatest severity of disease and risk for poor outcomes. Similar features were present between subgroups for predicting opioid misuse, but inequities were present.

This presents a barrier to engagement for patients who continue to use substances and who may be at high risk for complications of ongoing substance use such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), superficial and deep tissue infections, and overdose.

Here we tested the hypothesis that microglia might preferentially regulate hyperalgesic priming in male mice. We based this hypothesis on evidence that microglia preferentially contribute to neuropathic pain in male mice via ionotropic purinergic receptor (P2XR) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) signaling. Mice given a single-priming injection of the soluble human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6r) and then a second injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which unmasks hyperalgesic priming, shows a significant increase in levels of activated microglia at 3\u202fh following the PGE2 injection in both male and female mice. There was no change in microglia following PGE2. Intrathecal injection of the P2X3/4 inhibitor TNP-ATP blocked the initial response to IL-6r in both males and females, but only blocked hyperalgesic priming in male mice. Intrathecally applied p38 inhibitor, skepinone, had no effect on the initial response to IL-6r but attenuated hyperalgesic priming in males only. Neither TNP-ATP nor skepinone could reverse priming once it had already been established in male mice suggesting that these pathways must be inhibited early in the development of hyperalgesic priming to have an effect. Our work is consistent with previous findings that P2XR and p38 inhibition can lead to male-specific effects on pain behaviors in mice. However, given that we did not observe microglial activation at time points where these drugs were effective, our work also questions whether these effects can be completely attributed to microglia.", "abstract_id": 29913243, "entities": [{"entity": "P2XR or p38 signaling", "qualifier": ["in the spine"]}, {"entity": "Hyperalgesic priming", "qualifier": ["in male mice"]}, {"entity": "TNP-ATP", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Initial response to IL-6r", "qualifier": ["in both males and females"]}, {"entity": "Skepinone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Hyperalgesic priming", "qualifier": ["in males only"]}, {"entity": "TNP-ATP or Skepinone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Priming", "qualifier": ["once it had already been established in male mice"]}]}

Substantive adherence to treatments teaching these adaptive skills often proves challenging, resulting in poor individual and societal outcomes. Evidence demonstrates motivation for behavior change as a key predictor of treatment adherence. Despite behavioral techniques that target motivation, however, nonadherence persists as a barrier to positive clinical outcomes in chronic pain. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying treatment motivation might highlight novel avenues for augmentative therapies. The purpose of this review is to present theory and evidence that the mesocorticolimbic system (i.e., brain circuitry associated with reward processing and motivation) contributes to treatment motivation among chronic pain patients, ultimately influencing adherence. We review evidence for motivation as a key adherence determinant, detail neuroimaging findings relating mesocorticolimbic circuitry and motivation, and discuss data supporting mesocorticolimbic dysfunction among chronic pain patients. We propose a neurobehavioral model for adherence to pain self-management interventions, listing testable hypotheses.

The association of beta blockers to cognitive impairment in the presence of chronic pain is still unknown. To examine the independent association of beta-blocker use to cognitive impairment among adults with hypertension or Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs). We used a cross-sectional study design. We derived data on 8,279 adults from the 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Study participants were adults (age > 21 years), with hypertension or CVDs and without intracranial injury, Parkinson, Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementia. Cognitive impairment was measured based on 1) confusion or memory loss; 2) problems making decisions, or 3) supervision for participant's safety. Anti-hypertensive medications were categorized into 1) beta-blockers; 2) other anti-hypertensives; and 3) no antihypertensive medication. We used multivariable survey logistic regressions to examine the association between beta-blockers and cognitive impairment after controlling for biological factors, pain, chronic conditions, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare services, behavioral, socio-cultural and external environmental factors. Overall, 24.2%, 41.9%, and 33.9% reported using beta-blockers, other antihypertensives, and no antihypertensive medications, respectively; 18.1% participants reported cognitive impairment.

{"title": "A Novel Perioperative Multidose Methadone-Based Multimodal Analgesic Strategy in Children Achieved Safe and Low Analgesic Blood Methadone Levels Enabling Opioid-Sparing Sustained Analgesia With Minimal Adverse Effects.", "abstract": "Intraoperative methadone, a long-acting opioid, is increasingly used for postoperative analgesia, although the optimal methadone dosing strategy in children is still unknown. The use of a single large dose of intraoperative methadone is controversial due to inconsistent reductions in total opioid use in children and adverse effects. We recently demonstrated that small, repeated doses of methadone intraoperatively and postoperatively provided sustained analgesia and reduced opioid use without respiratory depression. The aim of this study was to characterize pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of a multiple small-dose methadone strategy. Adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion (PSF) for idiopathic scoliosis or pectus excavatum (PE) repair received methadone intraoperatively (0.1 mg/kg, maximum 5 mg) and postoperatively every 12 hours for 3-5 doses in a multimodal analgesic protocol. Blood samples were collected up to 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed for R-methadone and S-methadone, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene (EDDP) metabolites, and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG), the primary methadone-binding protein. Peak and trough concentrations of enantiomers, total methadone, and AAG levels were correlated with clinical outcomes including pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), respiratory depression, and QT interval prolongation. The study population included 38 children (10.8-17.9 years): 25 PSF and 13 PE patients. Median total methadone peak plasma concentration was 24.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 19.2-40.8) ng/mL and the median trough was 4.09 (IQR, 2.74-6.4) ng/mL. AAG concentration almost doubled at 48 hours after surgery (median = 193.9, IQR = 86.3-279.5 \u00b5g/mL) from intraoperative levels (median = 87.4, IQR = 70.6-115.8 \u00b5g/mL; P < .001), and change of AAG from intraoperative period to 48 hours postoperatively correlated with R-EDDP (P < .001) levels, S-EDDP (P < .001) levels, and pain scores (P = .008). Median opioid usage was minimal, 0.66 (IQR, 0.59-0.75) mg/kg morphine equivalents/d. No respiratory depression (95% Wilson binomial confidence, 0-0.09) or clinically significant QT prolongation (median = 9, IQR = -10 to 28 milliseconds) occurred. PONV occurred in 12 patients and was correlated with morphine equivalent dose (P = .005). Novel multiple small perioperative methadone doses resulted in safe and lower blood methadone levels, <100 ng/mL, a threshold previously associated with respiratory depression. This methadone dosing in a multimodal regimen resulted in lower blood methadone analgesia concentrations than the historically described minimum analgesic concentrations of methadone from an era before multimodal postoperative analgesia without postoperative respiratory depression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc).

Herein, we report on a class of lipids formed by the epoxidation of N-arachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA) and N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (NA5HT) by epoxygenases. EpoNADA and epoNA5HT are dual-functional rheostat modulators of the endocannabinoid-TRPV1 axis. EpoNADA and epoNA5HT are stronger modulators of TRPV1 than either NADA or NA5HT, and epoNA5HT displays a significantly stronger inhibition on TRPV1-mediated responses in primary afferent neurons. Moreover, epoNA5HT is a full CB1 agonist. These epoxides reduce the pro-inflammatory biomarkers IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and nitrous oxide and raise anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine in activated microglial cells. The epoxides are spontaneously generated by activated microglia cells and their formation is potentiated in the presence of anandamide. Detailed kinetics and molecular dynamics simulation studies provide evidence for this potentiation using the epoxygenase human CYP2J2. Taken together, inflammation leads to an increase in the metabolism of NADA, NA5HT and other eCBs by epoxygenases to form the corresponding epoxides. The epoxide metabolites are bioactive lipids that are potent, multi-faceted molecules, capable of influencing the activity of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors.", "abstract_id": 33568652, "entities": [{"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "TRPV1", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "EpoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CB1", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pro-inflammatory biomarkers", "qualifier": ["IL-6", "IL-1\u03b2", "TNF-\u03b1", "Nitrous oxide"]}, {"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "IL-10", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Inflammation", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}]}

SIM is especially important to examine given frequent undercounting of suicides amongst drug overdose deaths. We report suicide and SIM trends in the United States of America (US) during 1999-2018, portray interstate rate trends, and examine spatiotemporal (spacetime) diffusion or spread of the drug self-intoxication component of SIM, with attention to potential for differential suicide misclassification. For this state-based, cross-sectional, panel time series, we used de-identified manner and underlying cause-of-death data for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC) from CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Procedures comprised joinpoint regression to describe national trends; Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient to assess interstate SIM and suicide rate congruence; and spacetime hierarchical modelling of the 'nonsuicide' SIM component. The national annual average percentage change over the observation period in the SIM rate was 4.3% (95% CI: 3.3%, 5.4%; p<0.001) versus 1.8% (95% CI: 1.6%, 2.0%; p<0.001) for the suicide rate. By 2017/2018, all states except Nebraska (19.9) posted a SIM rate of at least 21.0 deaths per 100,000 population-the floor of the rate range for the top 5 ranking states in 1999/2000. The rank-order correlation coefficient for SIM and suicide rates was 0.82 (p<0.001) in 1999/2000 versus 0.34 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) by 2017/2018. Seven states in the West posted a\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.0% reduction in their standardised mortality ratios of 'nonsuicide' drug fatalities, relative to the national ratio, and 6 states from the other 3 major regions a >6.0% increase (p<0.05). Depiction of rising SIM trends across states and major regions unmasks a burgeoning national mental health crisis. Geographic variation is plausibly a partial product of local heterogeneity in toxic drug availability and the quality of medicolegal death investigations. Like COVID-19, the nation will only be able to prevent SIM by responding with collective, comprehensive, systemic approaches.

In-depth semi-structured interviews (n\u00a0=\u00a023) were conducted with programs for women and children affected by OUD across North America. Using a phenomenologic approach, key program components and themes were identified. Following thematic saturation, these results were triangulated with experts in program implementation and with a subset of key informants to ensure data integrity. Five distinct types of programs were identified that varied in the degree of medical and behavioral care for families. Three themes emerged unique to the provision of dyadic care: 1) families require supportive, frequent visits with a range of providers, but constraints around billable services limit care integration across the perinatal continuum; 2) individual program champions are critical, but degree and reach of interdisciplinary care is limited by siloed systems for medical and behavioral care; and 3) addressing dual, sometimes competing, responsibilities for both parental and infant health following recurrence of parental substance use presents unique challenges.

Participants with low back pain (LBP) in a clinical trial (n\u2009=\u2009241) examining nonpharmacologic treatments completed the 8-item UWCAP and 9-item UWPRSE and a numeric pain intensity rating, Oswestry Disability and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaires at baseline, 1-, 4- and 12-weeks after enrollment. Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients estimated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. Floor and ceiling effects for the UWCAP and UWPRSE were examined. Concurrent validity was evaluated with univariate correlation coefficients and predictive validity with multivariate regression models. Participants were divided into categories of treatment responsiveness based on a single-item global rating measure, and UWPRSE and UWCAP change scores and standardized effect sizes were calculated in each category. Both short forms had good internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.89-0.90) and test-retest reliability (ICC\u2009=\u20090.77-0.85), without substantial floor or ceiling effects.

{"title": "Brain Mechanisms of Virtual Reality Breathing Versus Traditional Mindful Breathing in Pain Modulation: Observational Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy Study.", "abstract": "Pain is a complex experience that involves sensory-discriminative and cognitive-emotional neuronal processes. It has long been known across cultures that pain can be relieved by mindful breathing (MB). There is a common assumption that MB exerts its analgesic effect through interoception. Interoception refers to consciously refocusing the mind's attention to the physical sensation of internal organ function. In this study, we dissect the cortical analgesic processes by imaging the brains of healthy subjects exposed to traditional MB (TMB) and compare them with another group for which we augmented MB to an outside sensory experience via virtual reality breathing (VRB). The VRB protocol involved in-house-developed virtual reality 3D lungs that synchronized with the participants' breathing cycles in real time, providing them with an immersive visual-auditory exteroception of their breathing. We found that both breathing interventions led to a significant increase in pain thresholds after week-long practices, as measured by a thermal quantitative sensory test. However, the underlying analgesic brain mechanisms were opposite, as revealed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy data. In the TMB practice, the anterior prefrontal cortex uniquely modulated the premotor cortex. This increased its functional connection with the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), thereby facilitating the S1-based sensory-interoceptive processing of breathing but inhibiting its other role in sensory-discriminative pain processing. In contrast, virtual reality induced an immersive 3D exteroception with augmented visual-auditory cortical activations, which diminished the functional connection with the S1 and consequently weakened the pain processing function of the S1. In summary, our study suggested two analgesic neuromechanisms of VRB and TMB practices-exteroception and interoception-that distinctively modulated the S1 processing of the ascending noxious inputs. This is in line with the concept of dualism (Yin and Yang).", "abstract_id": 34636731, "entities": [{"entity": "Mindful Breathing (MB)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Anterior Prefrontal Cortex", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Virtual Reality Breathing (VRB)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1)", "qualifier": null}]}

Patients exhibited enhanced connectivity between the left amygdala and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (cluster-level P-FDR < 0.05), whereas right amygdala rsFC showed no group differences. Only in patients, elevated catastrophizing was associated with facilitated threat-safety learning (CS+>CS-; rp = 0.49, P = 0.001). Furthermore, in patients, elevated catastrophizing was associated with reduced left amygdala connectivity with SMG / parietal operculum, and increased left amygdala connectivity with hippocampus, dorsal striatum, paracingulate, and motor regions (P < 0.001). In addition, blunted left amygdala rsFC with right SMG/parietal operculum mediated the association between catastrophizing and threat-safety learning (P < 0.001). To conclude, rsFC between the left amygdala (a core emotion hub) and inferior parietal lobe (involved in appraisal and integration of bodily signals and attentional reorienting) explains associations between daily-life relevant catastrophizing and threat-safety learning. Findings provide a putative model for understanding pathophysiology involved in core psychological processes that cut across diagnoses, including disabling pain, and are relevant for their etiology.", "abstract_id": 35302974, "entities": [{"entity": "Amygdala", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Catastrophizing", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Threat-safety discrimination learning", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Catastrophizing", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Amygdala connectivity", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Amygdala", "qualifier": ["left"]}, {"entity": "Supramarginal gyrus (SMG)", "qualifier": ["right"]}]}
{"title": "Early Life Stress and Risks for Opioid Misuse: Review of Data Supporting Neurobiological Underpinnings.", "abstract": "A robust body of research has shown that traumatic experiences occurring during critical developmental periods of childhood when neuronal plasticity is high increase risks for a spectrum of physical and mental health problems in adulthood, including substance use disorders. However, until recently, relatively few studies had specifically examined the relationships between early life stress (ELS) and opioid use disorder (OUD). Associations with opioid use initiation, injection drug use, overdose, and poor treatment outcome have now been demonstrated. In rodents, ELS has also been shown to increase the euphoric and decrease antinociceptive effects of opioids, but little is known about these processes in humans or about the neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie these relationships. This review aims to establish a theoretical model that highlights the mechanisms by which ELS may alter opioid sensitivity, thereby contributing to future risks for OUD. Alterations induced by ELS in mesocorticolimbic brain circuits, and endogenous opioid and dopamine neurotransmitter systems are described. The limited but provocative evidence linking these alterations with opioid sensitivity and risks for OUD is presented. Overall, the findings suggest that better understanding of these mechanisms holds promise for reducing vulnerability, improving prevention strategies, and prescribing guidelines for high-risk individuals.", "abstract_id": 33921642, "entities": [{"entity": "Early life stress (ELS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid use disorder (OUD)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Early life stress (ELS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid sensitivity", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Early life stress (ELS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Mesocorticolimbic brain circuits", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Early life stress (ELS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Endogenous opioid", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Early life stress (ELS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Dopamine neurotransmitter systems", "qualifier": null}]}
{"title": "High-fat diet exacerbates postoperative pain and inflammation in a sex-dependent manner.", "abstract": "Obesity is often associated with increased pain, but little is known about the effects of obesity and diet on postoperative pain. In this study, effects of diet and obesity were examined in the paw incision model, a preclinical model of postoperative pain. Long-Evans rats were fed high-fat diet (40% calories from butter fat) or low-fat normal chow. Male rats fed high-fat diet starting 6 weeks before incision (a diet previously shown to induce markers of obesity) had prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity and an overall increase in spontaneous pain in response to paw incision, compared with normal chow controls. Diet effects in females were minor. Removing high-fat diet for 2 weeks before incision reversed the diet effects on pain behaviors, although this was not enough time to reverse high-fat diet-induced weight gain. A shorter (1 week) exposure to high-fat diet before incision also increased pain behaviors in males, albeit to a lesser degree. The 6-week high-fat diet increased macrophage density as examined immunohistochemically in lumbar dorsal root ganglion even before paw incision, especially in males, and sensitized responses of peritoneal macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimuli in vitro. The nerve regeneration marker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) in skin near the incision (day 4) was higher in the high-fat diet group, and wound healing was delayed. In summary, high-fat diet increased postoperative pain particularly in males, but some diet effects did not depend on weight gain.

{"title": "Facilitation of neuropathic pain by the NPY Y1 receptor-expressing subpopulation of excitatory interneurons in the dorsal horn.", "abstract": "Endogenous neuropeptide Y (NPY) exerts long-lasting spinal inhibitory control of neuropathic pain, but its mechanism of action is complicated by the expression of its receptors at multiple sites in the dorsal horn: NPY Y1 receptors (Y1Rs) on post-synaptic neurons and both Y1Rs and Y2Rs at the central terminals of primary afferents. We found that Y1R-expressing spinal neurons contain multiple markers of excitatory but not inhibitory interneurons in the rat superficial dorsal horn. To test the relevance of this spinal population to the development and/or maintenance of acute and neuropathic pain, we selectively ablated Y1R-expressing interneurons with intrathecal administration of an NPY-conjugated saporin ribosomal neurotoxin that spares the central terminals of primary afferents. NPY-saporin decreased spinal Y1R immunoreactivity but did not change the primary afferent terminal markers isolectin B4 or calcitonin-gene-related peptide immunoreactivity. In the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, NPY-saporin decreased mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, but disrupted neither normal mechanical or thermal thresholds, motor coordination, nor locomotor activity. We conclude that Y1R-expressing excitatory dorsal horn interneurons facilitate neuropathic pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, this neuronal population remains sensitive to intrathecal NPY after nerve injury. This neuroanatomical and behavioral characterization of Y1R-expressing excitatory interneurons provides compelling evidence for the development of spinally-directed Y1R agonists to reduce chronic neuropathic pain.", "abstract_id": 31076578, "entities": [{"entity": "Y1R-expressing excitatory interneurons", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "neuropathic pain hypersensitivity", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NPY-conjugated saporin ribosomal neurotoxin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Y1R-expressing excitatory interneurons", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NPY-saporin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "mechanical and cold hypersensitivity", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Y1R agonists", "qualifier": ["potential"]}, {"entity": "chronic neuropathic pain", "qualifier": null}]}

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an over-the-counter supplement, has shown promise in treating a variety of substance use disorders, but little research has evaluated its merits as a treatment for AUD. This secondary analysis from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network examined the effects of NAC versus placebo on alcohol use among participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD) enrolled in a 12-week, multi-site cannabis cessation trial. Participants (N\u202f=\u202f302, ages 18-50) were randomized to double-blind NAC (1200\u202fmg, twice daily) or placebo.

People with OUD often experience comorbid medical conditions. Systematical approaches to identifying co-occurring conditions of OUD can facilitate a deeper understanding of OUD mechanisms and drug discovery. This study presents an integrated approach combining data mining, network construction and ranking, and hypothesis-driven case-control studies using patient electronic health records (EHRs). First, we mined comorbidities from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) of 12 million unique case reports using frequent pattern-growth algorithm. The performance of OUD comorbidity mining was measured by precision and recall using manually curated known OUD comorbidities. We then constructed a disease comorbidity network using mined association rules and further prioritized OUD comorbidities. Last, novel OUD comorbidities were independently tested using EHRs of 75 million unique patients. The OUD comorbidities from association rules mining achieves a precision of 38.7% and a recall of 78.2 Based on the mined rules, the global DCN was constructed with 1916 nodes and 32,175 edges. The network-based OUD ranking result shows that 43 of 55 known OUD comorbidities were in the first decile with a precision of 78.2%. Hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes were two top-ranked novel OUD comorbidities identified by data mining and network ranking algorithms. Based on EHR-based case-control studies, we showed that patients with OUD had significantly increased risk for hyperthyroidism (AOR\u2009=\u20091.46, 95% CI 1.43-1.49, p value\u2009<\u20090.001), hypothyroidism (AOR\u2009=\u20091.45, 95% CI 1.42-1.48, p value\u2009<\u20090.001), type 2-diabetes (AOR\u2009=\u20091.28, 95% CI 1.26-1.29, p value\u2009<\u20090.001), compared with individuals without OUD.

{"title": "Addressing identification bias in the design and analysis of cluster-randomized pragmatic trials: a case study.", "abstract": "Pragmatic trials provide the opportunity to study the effectiveness of health interventions to improve care in real-world settings. However, use of open-cohort designs with patients becoming eligible after randomization and reliance on electronic health records (EHRs) to identify participants may lead to a form of selection bias referred to as identification bias. This bias can occur when individuals identified as a result of the treatment group assignment are included in analyses. To demonstrate the importance of identification bias and how it can be addressed, we consider a motivating case study, the PRimary care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) Trial. PROUD is an ongoing pragmatic, cluster-randomized implementation trial in six health systems to evaluate a program for increasing medication treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs). A main study objective is to evaluate whether the PROUD intervention decreases acute care utilization among patients with OUD (effectiveness aim). Identification bias is a particular concern, because OUD is underdiagnosed in the EHR at baseline, and because the intervention is expected to increase OUD diagnosis among current patients and attract new patients with OUD to the intervention site. We propose a framework for addressing this source of bias in the statistical design and analysis. The statistical design sought to balance the competing goals of fully capturing intervention effects and mitigating identification bias, while maximizing power. For the primary analysis of the effectiveness aim, identification bias was avoided by defining the study sample using pre-randomization data (pre-trial modeling demonstrated that the optimal approach was to use individuals with a prior OUD diagnosis). To expand generalizability of study findings, secondary analyses were planned that also included patients newly diagnosed post-randomization, with analytic methods to account for identification bias. As more studies seek to leverage existing data sources, such as EHRs, to make clinical trials more affordable and generalizable and to apply novel open-cohort study designs, the potential for identification bias is likely to become increasingly common. This case study highlights how this bias can be addressed in the statistical study design and analysis. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03407638.

{"title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of medications for stimulant use disorders in patients with co-occurring opioid use disorders.", "abstract": "Stimulant (cocaine and/or methamphetamine) use has increased among people with opioid use disorder. We conducted a systematic review of medications for stimulant use disorders in this population. We searched for randomized controlled trials in multiple databases through April 2019, and dual-screened studies using pre-specified inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes were abstinence defined as stimulant-negative urine screens for \u22653 consecutive weeks; overall use as the proportion of stimulant-negative urine specimens; and retention as the proportion of participants who completed treatment. We rated strength of evidence using established criteria and conducted meta-analyses of comparable interventions and outcomes. Thirty-four trials of 22 medications focused on cocaine use disorder in patients with opioid use disorder. Most studies enrolled participants stabilized on opioid maintenence therapy, generally methadone. None of the six studies that assessed abstinence found significant differences between groups. We found moderate-strength evidence that antidepressants (desipramine, bupropion, and fluoxetine) worsened retention. There was moderate-strength evidence that disulfiram worsened treatment retention (N = 605, RR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.77 to 0.95). We found low-strength evidence that psychostimulants (mazindol and dexamphetamine) may reduce cocaine use, though the difference was not statistically significant (standard mean difference 0.35 [95 % CI -0.05 to 0.74]).

To assess opioid prescribing patterns between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, in a network of safety-net clinics serving high-risk patients. Cross-sectional study of 3\u202f227\u202f459 opioid prescriptions abstracted from the electronic health records of 2\u202f129\u202f097 unique primary care patients treated from 2009 through 2018 at a network of CHCs that included 449 clinic sites in 17 states. All age groups were included in the analysis. The following measures were described at the population level for each study year: (1) percentage of patients with at least 1 prescription for an opioid by age and sex, (2) number of opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (3) number of long-acting opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (4) mean annual morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per patient, (5) mean MME per prescription, (6) number of chronic opioid users, and (7) mean of high-dose opioid users. The study population included 2\u202f129\u202f097 patients (1\u202f158\u202f413 women [54.4%]) with a mean (SD) age of 32.2 (21.1) years and a total of 3\u202f227\u202f459 opioid prescriptions. The percentage of patients receiving at least 1 opioid prescription in a calendar year declined 67.4% from 15.9% in 2009 to 5.2% in 2018. Over the 10-year study period, a greater percentage of women received a prescription (13.1%) compared with men (10.9%), and a greater percentage of non-Hispanic White patients (18.1%) received an opioid prescription compared with non-Hispanic Black patients (9.5%), non-Hispanic patients who self-identified as other races (8.0%), and Hispanic patients (6.9%). The number of opioid prescriptions for every 100 patients decreased 73.7% from 110.8 in 2009 to 29.1 in 2018. The number of long-acting opioids for every 100 patients decreased 85.5% during the same period, from 22.0 to 3.2. The MMEs per patient decreased from 1682.7 in 2009 to 243.1 in 2018, a decline of 85.6%. In this cross-sectional study, the opioid prescribing rate in 2009 in the CHC network was higher than national population estimates but began to decline earlier and more precipitously.

{"title": "Kratom policy: The challenge of balancing therapeutic potential with public safety.", "abstract": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tree-like plant indigenous to Southeast Asia. Its leaves, and the teas brewed from them have long been used by people in that region to stave off fatigue and to manage pain and opioid withdrawal. Evidence suggests kratom is being increasingly used by people in the United States and Europe for the self-management of opioid withdrawal and treatment of pain. Recent studies have confirmed that kratom and its chemical constituents have potentially useful pharmacological actions. However, there have also been increasing numbers of reports of adverse effects resulting from use of kratom products. In August 2016, the US Drug Enforcement Administration announced plans to classify kratom and its mitragynine constituents as Schedule I Controlled Substances, a move that triggered a massive response from pro-kratom advocates. The debate regarding the risks, and benefits and safety of kratom continues to intensify. Kratom proponents tout kratom as a safer and less addictive alternative to opioids for the management of pain and opioid addiction. The anti-kratom faction argues that kratom, itself, is a dangerous and addictive drug that ought to be banned. Given the widespread use of kratom and the extensive media attention it is receiving, it is important for physicians, scientists and policy makers to be knowledgeable about the subject. The purpose of this commentary is to update readers about recent developments and controversies in this rapidly evolving area. All of the authors are engaged in various aspects of kratom research and it is our intention to provide a fair and balanced overview that can form the basis for informed decisions on kratom policy. Our conclusions from these analyses are: (a) User reports and results of preclinical studies in animals strongly suggest that kratom and its main constituent alkaloid, mitragynine may have useful activity in alleviating pain and managing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, even though well-controlled clinical trials have yet to be done. (b) Even though kratom lacks many of the toxicities of classic opioids, there are legitimate concerns about the safety and lack of quality control of purported \"kratom\" products that are being sold in the US. (c) The issues regarding the safety and efficacy of kratom and its mitragynine constituent can only be resolved by additional research. Classification of the Mitragyna alkaloids as Schedule I controlled substances would substantially impede this important research on kratom.", "abstract_id": 31103778, "entities": [{"entity": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid withdrawal", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Mitragynine", "qualifier": ["main constituent of Kratom"]}, {"entity": "Pharmacological actions", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Adverse effects", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioids", "qualifier": null}]}

This study aims to determine if altered trunk control associated with recurrent low back pain persists beyond symptom duration. Twenty young adults with recurrent LBP were tested once during an LBP episode and once in symptom remission, and twenty matched back-healthy participants served as controls. Participants walked on a treadmill with five prescribed step widths (0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.33, 1.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0preferred step width). Motion capture and surface electromyography were used to record trunk kinematics and muscle activation. Thorax-pelvis coordination was calculated using vector coding, and longissimus activation and co-activation were analyzed. Young adults with recurrent LBP exhibited a \"looser\" trunk control strategy in the frontal plane during gait that was persistent regardless of pain status across multiple step widths compared to controls. The looser trunk control was demonstrated by a greater pelvis-only, less thorax-only coordination pattern, and decreased bilateral longissimus co-activation in individuals with recurrent LBP compared to controls. The looser trunk control strategy was further amplified when individuals were in symptom remission and exhibited greater trunk excursion and reduced in-phase coordination in the frontal plane. The amplification of aberrant movement during symptom remission may suggest that movement patterns or anatomical factors existing prior to the tested painful episode underlie altered trunk control in individuals with recurrent LBP.

Our objective was to identify and describe abnormalities among the comprehensive metabolic and lipid panels of individuals taking prescription opioids. We performed a cross-sectional study of the laboratory values with 3 cycles (2011-2016) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in March 2020. NHANES sampling is conducted using a multistaged, stratified, cluster sampling technique to create a representative sample of the United States. We excluded patients with histories of cancer and under the age of 25 years. Our final sample size was 11,061 (n = 162,547,635), with 797 reportedly using a prescription opioid in the past 30 days-a weighted percent representing 22.95% of the US population. Our analyses identified mean differences in biomarkers between individuals taking prescription opioids and the US population. Laboratory values from the comprehensive metabolic panel were all within reference ranges for both groups, with only bilirubin levels being statistically lower in the group currently taking prescription opioids. Values from the lipid panel of both the opioid using and comparison groups were above reference range for total cholesterol and fasting glucose.

While our study uses a large sample for a robust generalizable analysis it is a correlation study and a longitudinal cohort would provide better evidence linking potential disease states to prescription opioid use. Although all Americans should be alarmed at the lipid levels reported in this study, specific combinations of heightened lipid laboratory values among prescription opioid users accelerate the trajectories toward comorbidities-heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes-leading to diminished quality of life.

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) methods are commonly used in evaluating the results of RCTs, but they are seldom used for designing RCTs. We present a step-by-step overview to objectively design RCTs via CEA methods and specifically determine the cost effectiveness of a RI period in a CP RCT. We applied the CEA methodology to data obtained from several noninvasive brain stimulation CP RCTs, specifically focusing on (1) defining the CEA research question, (2) identifying RCT phases and cost ingredients, (3) discounting, (4) modeling the stochastic nature of the RCT, and (5) performing sensitivity analyses. We assessed the average cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental cost effectiveness ratios of varied RCT designs and the impact on cost-effectiveness by the inclusion of a RI period vs. No-Run-In (NRI) period.

Mainly characterized by articular cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation, subchondral bone remodeling, and synovial inflammation, OA is a heterogeneous disease that impacts all component tissues of the articular joint organ. Pathological changes, and thus symptoms, vary from person to person, underscoring the critical need of personalized therapies. However, there has only been limited progress towards the prevention and treatment of OA, and there are no approved effective disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs). Conventional treatments, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy, are still the major remedies to manage the symptoms until the need for total joint replacement. In this review, we provide an update of the known OA risk factors and relevant mechanisms of action. In addition, given that the lack of biologically relevant models to recapitulate human OA pathogenesis represents one of the major roadblocks in developing DMOADs, we discuss current in vivo and in vitro experimental OA models, with special emphasis on recent development and application potential of human cell-derived microphysiological tissue chip platforms.", "abstract_id": 32751156, "entities": [{"entity": "Osteoarthritis (OA)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "millions of people worldwide", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Osteoarthritis (OA)", "qualifier": ["articular cartilage degradation", "osteophyte formation", "subchondral bone remodeling", "synovial inflammation"]}, {"entity": "personalized therapies", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Osteoarthritis (OA)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Human cell-derived microphysiological tissue chip platforms", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis", "qualifier": null}]}
{"title": "Oxycodone in the Opioid Epidemic: High 'Liking', 'Wanting', and Abuse Liability.", "abstract": "It is estimated that nearly a third of people who abuse drugs started with prescription opioid medicines. Approximately, 11.5 million Americans used prescription drugs recreationally in 2016, and in 2018, 46,802 Americans died as the result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl (National Institutes on Drug Abuse (2020) Opioid Overdose Crisis. https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis . Accessed 06 June 2020). Yet physicians will continue to prescribe oral opioids for moderate-to-severe pain in the absence of alternative therapeutics, underscoring the importance in understanding how drug choice can influence detrimental outcomes. One of the opioid prescription medications that led to this crisis is oxycodone, where misuse of this drug has been rampant. Being one of the most highly prescribed opioid medications for treating moderate-to-severe pain as reflected in the skyrocketed increase in retail sales of 866% between 1997 and 2007, oxycodone was initially suggested to be less addictive than morphine. The false-claimed non-addictive formulation of oxycodone, OxyContin, further contributed to the opioid crisis. Abuse was often carried out by crushing the pills for immediate burst release, typically by nasal insufflation, or by liquefying the pills for intravenous injection. Here, we review oxycodone pharmacology and abuse liability as well as present the hypothesis that oxycodone may exhibit a unique pharmacology that contributes to its high likability and abuse susceptibility. We will discuss various mechanisms that likely contribute to the high abuse rate of oxycodone including clinical drug likability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, differences in its actions within mesolimbic reward circuity compared to other opioids, and the possibility of differential molecular and cellular receptor interactions that contribute to its selective effects. We will also discuss marketing strategies and drug difference that likely contributes to the oxycodone opioid use disorders and addiction.", "abstract_id": 33245509, "entities": [{"entity": "Oxycodone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid use disorders", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Oxycodone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Addiction", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Oxycodone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Mesolimbic reward circuitry", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Oxycodone", "qualifier": ["initially suggested to be less addictive than Morphine"]}, {"entity": "Opioid", "qualifier": null}]}

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among Americans and more than 44 K people died by suicide in 2019 in the United States. Patients with chronic pain, including, but not limited to, those with substance use disorders, are particularly vulnerable. Chronic pain patients have twice the risk of death by suicide compared to those without pain, and 50% of chronic pain patients report that they have considered suicide at some point due to their pain. The kappa opioid system is implicated in negative mood states including dysphoria, depression, and anxiety, and recent evidence shows that chronic pain increases the function of this system in limbic brain regions important for affect and motivation. Additionally, dynorphin, the endogenous ligand that activates the kappa opioid receptor is increased in the caudate putamen of human suicide victims. A potential treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts is buprenorphine. Buprenorphine, a partial mu opioid agonist with kappa opioid antagonist properties, reduced suicidal ideation in chronic pain patients with and without an opioid use disorder. This review will highlight the clinical and preclinical evidence to support the use of buprenorphine in mitigating pain-induced negative affective states and suicidal thoughts, where these effects are at least partially mediated via its kappa antagonist properties.", "abstract_id": 35265942, "entities": [{"entity": "Buprenorphine", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Suicidal ideation", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Chronic pain patients", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Kappa opioid system", "qualifier": ["increased function"]}, {"entity": "Dynorphin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Kappa opioid receptor", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Buprenorphine", "qualifier": ["kappa opioid antagonist properties"]}, {"entity": "Kappa opioid system", "qualifier": null}]}

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network initiated an observational study of mother-to-child transmission of HCV in 2012 that included offering HCV antibody screening to their entire obstetric population. Women presenting for prenatal care before 23 weeks of gestation without a known multifetal gestation were eligible. For each woman who was HCV antibody-positive, two women at similar gestational age who were HCV antibody-negative were identified and included for comparison. Risk factors were evaluated by patient interview and chart review. Women in the case group were identified to have a signal-to-cutoff value of at least 5 on the Abbott ARCHITECT platform. RNA status was evaluated for women in the case group. Of 106,842 women screened for the HCV antibody, 254 had positive results. The HCV antibody seroprevalence rate was 2.4 cases per 1,000 women (95% CI 2.1-2.7). One hundred thirty-one women in the case group and 251 women in the control group were included in the case-control analysis.

The SFP includes 3 episodes: baseline, maternal still-face, and reunion. Maternal and infant positive and negative affect were scored by masked reliable coders. Data were analyzed using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model to test the hypotheses that each partner's affectivity during the baseline episode would predict their own affectivity during the reunion episode (actor effects). We also expected that each partner's affectivity during the baseline episode would influence the other partner's affectivity during the reunion episodes (partner effects). After controlling for infant sex and maternal education, results provided evidence for actor effects for maternal and infant positive affect, and for partner effects for maternal baseline positive affect to infant positive affect during the reunion. One significant partner effect was observed for negative affect: Infant negativity during baseline predicted greater maternal negativity during reunion. Findings confirm that both mothers and infants contribute to dyadic affective processes during the SFP but specific findings vary depending on the affective valence in question.

{"title": "Functional Connectome of the Fetal Brain.", "abstract": "Large-scale functional connectome formation and reorganization is apparent in the second trimester of pregnancy, making it a crucial and vulnerable time window in connectome development. Here we identified which architectural principles of functional connectome organization are initiated before birth, and contrast those with topological characteristics observed in the mature adult brain. A sample of 105 pregnant women participated in human fetal resting-state fMRI studies (fetal gestational age between 20 and 40 weeks). Connectome analysis was used to analyze weighted network characteristics of fetal macroscale brain wiring. We identified efficient network attributes, common functional modules, and high overlap between the fetal and adult brain network. Our results indicate that key features of the functional connectome are present in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Understanding the organizational principles of fetal connectome organization may bring opportunities to develop markers for early detection of alterations of brain function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The fetal to neonatal period is well known as a critical stage in brain development. Rapid neurodevelopmental processes establish key functional neural circuits of the human brain. Prenatal risk factors may interfere with early trajectories of connectome formation and thereby shape future health outcomes. Recent advances in MRI have made it possible to examine fetal brain functional connectivity. In this study, we evaluate the network topography of normative functional network development during connectome genesis in utero Understanding the developmental trajectory of brain connectivity provides a basis for understanding how the prenatal period shapes future brain function and disease dysfunction.", "abstract_id": 31685648, "entities": [{"entity": "Fetal Brain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Functional Connectome", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Resting-state fMRI studies", "qualifier": ["on pregnant women"]}, {"entity": "Macroscale brain wiring", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Functional Connectome", "qualifier": ["in fetal brain"]}, {"entity": "Adult Brain Network", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Understanding", "qualifier": ["of fetal connectome organization"]}, {"entity": "Brain Function", "qualifier": ["alterations"]}]}
{"title": "An examination of maternal prenatal BMI and human fetal brain development.", "abstract": "Prenatal development is a time when the brain is acutely vulnerable to insult and alteration by environmental factors (e.g., toxins, maternal health). One important risk factor is maternal obesity (Body Mass Index\u00a0>\u00a030). Recent research indicates that high maternal BMI during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for numerous physical health, cognitive, and mental health problems in offspring across the lifespan. It is possible that heightened maternal prenatal BMI influences the developing brain even before birth. The present study examines this possibility at the level of macrocircuitry in the human fetal brain. Using a data-driven strategy for parcellating the brain into subnetworks, we test whether MRI functional connectivity within or between fetal neural subnetworks varies with maternal prenatal BMI in 109 fetuses between the ages of 26 and 39weeks. We discovered that strength of connectivity between two subnetworks, left anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus (aIN/IFG) and bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), varied with maternal BMI. At the level of individual aIN/IFG-PFC connections, we observed both increased and decreased between-network connectivity with a tendency for increased within-hemisphere connectivity and reduced cross-hemisphere connectivity in higher BMI pregnancies. Maternal BMI was not associated with global differences in network topography based on network-based statistical analyses. Overall effects were localized in regions that will later support behavioral regulation and integrative processes, regions commonly associated with obesity-related deficits. By establishing onset in neural differences prior to birth, this study supports a model in which maternal BMI-related risk is associated with fetal connectome-level brain organization with implications for offspring long-term cognitive development and mental health.", "abstract_id": 32779186, "entities": [{"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Human fetal brain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fetal neural subnetworks", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "aIN/IFG-PFC connections", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fetal connectome-level brain organization", "qualifier": null}]}

The behavioral implications were also examined. Magnitude-wise, through summing across individual drug effects, our results highlighted ~5% of whole-brain functional connections (FCs) affected by PDE, which was highly comparable with the combined effects of the five nond rug variables. Spatially, the detected PDE effects featured drug-specific patterns with a common bias in higher-order brain regions/networks. Regarding brain-behavioral relationships, the detected connections showing significant drug effects also demonstrated significant correlations with 3-month behavioral outcomes. Further mediation analyses supported a mediation role of the detected brain FCs between PDE status and cognitive/language outcomes.

At approximately age 20, participants reported on their misuse of opioids defined as lifetime use of heroin or misuse of prescription opioids. Higher levels of peer nominations for aggressive behavior in first grade predicted a greater likelihood of opioid misuse. An interaction between participant sex and attention problems was observed such that females higher in attention problems were more likely to misuse opioids, particularly prescription opioids, than females lower in attention problems. An interaction was also found between participant sex and peer likability such that males lower in peer-nominated likability were more likely to misuse opioids relative to males higher in likability.

This study utilizes propensity score methods for causal inference to robustly account for shared risk factors between maternal and offspring smoking. An 8-year longitudinal cohort of 900 adolescents in the Chicago area were followed starting from approximately age 15.6. The effects of maternal lifetime smoking (MLS) and prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) (among participants reporting MLS) on offspring's past 30-day smoking, daily smoking status and smoking frequency were examined using logistic regression and Poisson regression after nearest-neighbor propensity matching. Age dependency of this relationship was then examined across the age range of 15-25 using time-varying effect modeling. Propensity matching yielded 438 and 132 pairs for MLS and PTE study samples, respectively. MLS demonstrated significant associations with past 30-day smoking (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.14), daily smoking (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.12), and smoking frequency of offspring (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15-1.52), with stable effects across age. Among participants reporting MLS, having PTE showed significant additional effects on daily smoking (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and age-dependency that showed significance during young adulthood but not adolescence.

A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts).

However, what contributes to these racial health disparities remains poorly understood. Using a sample of 1577 older adults (32.7% Black; ages 55-65 at baseline), we examined whether stress, health behaviors, social isolation, and inflammation are associated with racial disparities in self-reported physical health. A latent cumulative stress factor and unique stress-domain specific factors were modeled by applying bifactor confirmatory analysis to assessments across the lifespan (i.e., childhood maltreatment, trauma exposure, discrimination, stressful life events, and indices of socioeconomic status). Physical health, health behavior, and social isolation were assessed using self-report. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assayed from morning fasting serum samples; a z-scored inflammation index was formed across these 2 cytokines. A parallel serial mediational model tested whether race (i.e., Black/White) is indirectly associated with health through the following 3 independent pathways: (1) cumulative stress to preventative health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating) to inflammation, (2) cumulative stress to risky health behaviors (e.g., substance use) to inflammation; and (3) cumulative stress to social isolation to inflammation. There were significant indirect effects between race and self-reported physical health through cumulative stress, preventative health behaviors, and inflammation (B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.02, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01). Specifically, Black Americans were exposed to greater cumulative stress, which was associated with reduced engagement in preventative health behaviors, which was, in turn, associated with greater inflammation and reduced physical health. A unique SES factor also indirectly linked race to physical health through preventative health behaviors. Cumulative stress exposure and unique aspects of socioeconomic status are indirectly associated with Black-White racial health disparities through behavioral (i.e., preventative health behavior) and biological (i.e., inflammation) factors. Culturally responsive evidence-based interventions that enhance engagement in preventative health behaviors are needed to directly confront health disparities.

Children showed similar community structure to adults, as defined by Yeo and colleagues in 2011, in early-developing sensory and motor communities, but differences emerged in transmodal areas. Children have more cortical territory in the limbic community, which is involved in emotion processing, than adults. Regions in association cortex interact more flexibly across communities, creating uncertainty for the model-based assignment algorithm, and perhaps reflecting cortical boundaries that are not yet solidified. Uncertainty was highest for cingulo-opercular areas involved in flexible deployment of cognitive control.

Some children in these environments struggle with early onset externalizing problems that are associated with a variety of negative long-term outcomes. While previous research has linked parenting daily hassles to child externalizing problems, the role of frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) as a potential modifier of this relationship has scarcely been explored. The present study examined mother-child dyads, most of whom were living in low socioeconomic status households in an urban environment and self-identified as members of racial minority groups. Analyses focused on frustration task electroencephalography (EEG) data from 67 children (mean age = 59.0 months, SD = 2.6). Mothers reported the frequency of their daily parenting hassles and their child's externalizing problems. Frustration task FAA moderated the relationship between parenting daily hassles and child externalizing problems, but resting FAA did not. More specifically, children with left frontal asymmetry had more externalizing problems as their mothers perceived more hassles in their parenting role, but parenting hassles and externalizing problems were not associated among children with right frontal asymmetry. These findings lend support to the motivational direction hypothesis and capability model of FAA. More generally, this study reveals how individual differences in lateralization of cortical activity in response to a stressor may confer differential susceptibility to child behavioral problems with approach motivation (i.e., left frontal asymmetry) predicting externalizing problems under conditions of parental stress.", "abstract_id": 35864992, "entities": [{"entity": "Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Stress", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Parenting Hassles", "qualifier": ["as perceived by mothers"]}, {"entity": "Child Externalizing Problems", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Children", "qualifier": ["with right frontal asymmetry"]}, {"entity": "Parenting Hassles", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Cortical Activity", "qualifier": ["lateralization in response to stress"]}, {"entity": "Child Externalizing Problems", "qualifier": null}]}

To allocate adequate resources and develop appropriately scaled public health responses, accurate estimation of the prevalence of OUD is needed. Indirect methods (e.g., a multiplier method) of estimating prevalence of problematic substance-use behavior circumvent some limitations of household surveys and use of administrative data. We used a multiplier method to estimate OUD prevalence among the adult Medicaid population (ages 18-64 years) in 19 Ohio counties that are highly affected by overdose. We used Medicaid claims data and the US National Vital Statistics System overdose death data, which were linked at the person level. A statistical model leveraged opioid-related death rate information from a group with known OUD to estimate prevalence among a group with unknown OUD status given recorded opioid-related deaths in that group. We estimated that 13.6% of the total study population had OUD in 2019. Men (16.7%) had a higher prevalence of OUD than women (11.4%), and persons aged 35-54 had the highest prevalence (16.7%).

The thalamus plays a pivotal role in the pathomechanism of pain and headache, yet the role of the thalamus in PTH attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains unclear. A total of 107 participants underwent multimodal T1-weighted and T2* brain magnetic resonance imaging. Using a clinic-based observational study, thalamic subfield volume and thalamic iron accumulation were explored in 52 individuals with acute PTH (mean age\u00a0=\u00a041.3; standard deviation [SD]\u00a0=\u00a013.5), imaged on average 24\u2009days post mTBI, and compared to 55 healthy controls (mean age\u00a0=\u00a038.3; SD\u00a0=\u00a011.7) without history of mTBI or migraine.

{"title": "Headache classification and automatic biomarker extraction from structural MRIs using deep learning.", "abstract": "Data-driven machine-learning methods on neuroimaging (e.g. MRI) are of great interest for the investigation and classification of neurological diseases. However, traditional machine learning requires domain knowledge to delineate the brain regions first, followed by feature extraction from the regions. Compared with this semi-automated approach, recently developed deep learning methods have advantages since they do not require such prior knowledge; instead, deep learning methods can automatically find features that differentiate MRIs from different cohorts. In the present study, we developed a deep learning-based classification pipeline distinguishing brain MRIs of individuals with one of three types of headaches [migraine (n = 95), acute post-traumatic headache (n = 48) and persistent post-traumatic headache (n = 49)] from those of healthy controls (n = 532) and identified the brain regions that most contributed to each classification task. Our pipeline included: (i) data preprocessing; (ii) binary classification of healthy controls versus headache type using a 3D ResNet-18; and (iii) biomarker extraction from the trained 3D ResNet-18. During the classification at the second step of our pipeline, we resolved two common issues in deep learning methods, limited training data and imbalanced samples from different categories, by incorporating a large public data set and resampling among the headache cohorts. Our method achieved the following classification accuracies when tested on independent test sets: (i) migraine versus healthy controls-75% accuracy, 66.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity; (2) acute post-traumatic headache versus healthy controls-75% accuracy, 66.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity; and (3) persistent post-traumatic headache versus healthy controls-91.7% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity. The most significant biomarkers identified by the classifier for migraine were caudate, caudal anterior cingulate, superior frontal, thalamus and ventral diencephalon. For acute post-traumatic headache, lateral occipital, cuneus, lingual, pericalcarine and superior parietal regions were identified as most significant biomarkers. Finally, for persistent post-traumatic headache, the most significant biomarkers were cerebellum, middle temporal, inferior temporal, inferior parietal and superior parietal. In conclusion, our study shows that the deep learning methods can automatically detect aberrations in the brain regions associated with different headache types. It does not require any human knowledge as input which significantly reduces human effort. It uncovers the great potential of deep learning methods for classification and automatic extraction of brain imaging-based biomarkers for these headache types.", "abstract_id": 36751567, "entities": [{"entity": "Deep learning-based classification pipeline", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Brain MRIs", "qualifier": ["Migraine", "Acute post-traumatic headache", "Persistent post-traumatic headache", "Healthy controls"]}, {"entity": "Deep learning methods", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Aberrations in brain regions", "qualifier": ["associated with different headache types"]}, {"entity": "Deep learning methods", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Biomarkers", "qualifier": ["for different headache types"]}]}
{"title": "Multi-domain biopsychosocial postoperative recovery trajectories associate with patient outcomes following lumbar fusion.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe and assess the impact of multi-domain biopsychosocial (BPS) recovery on outcomes following lumbar spine fusion. We hypothesized that discrete patterns of BPS recovery (e.g., clusters) would be identified, and then associated with postoperative outcomes and preoperative patient data. Patient-reported outcomes for pain, disability, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and social roles were collected at multiple timepoints for patients undergoing lumbar fusion between baseline and one year. Multivariable latent class mixed models assessed composite recovery as a function of (1) pain, (2) pain and disability, and (3) pain, disability, and additional BPS factors. Patients were assigned to clusters based on their composite recovery trajectories over time. Using all BPS outcomes from 510 patients undergoing lumbar fusion, three multi-domain postoperative recovery clusters were identified: Gradual BPS Responders (11%), Rapid BPS Responders (36%), and Rebound Responders (53%). Modeling recovery from pain alone or pain and disability alone failed to generate meaningful or distinct recovery clusters. BPS recovery clusters were associated with number of levels fused and preoperative opioid use. Postoperative opioid use (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and hospital length of stay (p\u2009<\u20090.01) were associated with BPS recovery clusters even after adjusting for confounding factors.

PRSs are not typically trained in evidence-based interventions (EBIs) outside of motivational interviewing, although evidence demonstrates the feasibility of PRS delivery of certain EBIs, such as a brief behavioral intervention, behavioral activation. However, characteristics that predict PRS competency in delivering EBIs such as behavioral activation remain unknown, and are critical for PRS selection, training, and supervision if the PRS role is expanded. This study aimed to explore the outcomes of a brief PRS training period in behavioral activation and identify predictors of competence. Twenty PRSs in the United States completed a two-hour training on PRS-delivered behavioral activation. Participants completed baseline and post-training assessments, including roleplay and assessments of PRS characteristics, attitudes towards EBIs, and theoretically relevant personality constructs. Roleplays were coded for competence (behavioral activation specific and PRS skills more broadly, i.e., PRS competence) and changes were assessed from baseline to post-training. Linear regression models tested factors predicting post-training competence, controlling for baseline competence. There was a significant pre-post increase in behavioral activation competence (t = -7.02, p < 0.001). Years working as a PRS significantly predicted post-training behavioral activation skills (B = 0.16, p = 0.005). No variables predicted post-training PRS competence. This study provides preliminary evidence that behavioral activation may be appropriate for dissemination to PRSs through brief trainings, particularly for PRSs with more work experience.

Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded. In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO. Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested. The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO. Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory). The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining. In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups.

Five Chinese patients with 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency were genotyped. The five patients derived from four families living in Shandong Province, China. The diagnosis of 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency was initially established through HPLC serum adrenal profiles in Qilu Hospital, China, from 1983-1993. Three CYP17 gene mutations were identified from these patients. Among them, V311fs and Y329fs are two novel frame-shifting mutations. V311fs is an 8-bp nucleotide (TTAAATGG) deletion in exon 5. Y329fs is a deletion-insertion combined mutation (TAC-->AA) at codon 329 in exon 6. Two homozygotes for Y329fs and one compound heterozygote for Y329fs and V311fs were identified from three different families. Two homozygous sisters for the D487_S488_F489 deletion were identified. The results confirmed the diagnostic value of the HPLC serum adrenal profile for 17alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. The D487_S488_F489 deletion had been identified in two previously genotyped Chinese families. In our present study, a third Chinese family with this mutation was identified, suggesting that this mutation is a prevalent CYP17 mutation in the Chinese population. The identification of Y329fs mutation in addition to three previously identified mutations at codon 329 suggests that codon 329 is an unstable point of the CYP17 gene.

One of the common functional polymorphisms of GSTP1 is A\u2192G at nucleotide 313, which results in an amino acid substitution (Ile105Val) at the substrate binding site of GSTP1 and reduces catalytic activity of GSTP1. To investigate the GSTP1 Ile105Val genotype frequency in prostate cancer cases in the Kashmiri population, we designed a case-control study, in which 50 prostate cancer cases and 45 benign prostate hyperplasia cases were studied for GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism, compared to 80 controls taken from the general population, employing the PCR-RFLP technique. We found the frequency of the three different genotypes of GSTP1 Ile105Val in our ethnic Kashmir population, i.e., Ile/Ile, Ile/Val and Val/Val, to be 52.4, 33.3 and 14.3% among prostate cancer cases, 48.5, 37.5 and 14% among benign prostate hyperplasia cases and 73.8, 21.3 and 5% in the control population, respectively.

In IEC-6 crypt cells and jejunum enteroids quantitative RT-PCR showed a time- and dose-dependent upregulation of lpa2 in response to \u03b3-irradiation that was abolished by mutation of the NF-\u03baB site in the lpa2 promoter or by inhibition of ATM/ATR kinases with CGK-733, suggesting that lpa2 is a DNA damage response gene upregulated by ATM via NF-\u03baB. The resolution kinetics of the DNA damage marker \u03b3-H2AX in LPA-treated IEC-6 cells exposed to \u03b3-irradiation was accelerated compared to vehicle, whereas pharmacological inhibition of LPA2 delayed the resolution of \u03b3-H2AX. In LPA2-reconstituted MEF cells lacking LPA1&3 the levels of \u03b3-H2AX decreased rapidly, whereas in Vector MEF were high and remained sustained. Inhibition of ERK1&2 or PI3K/AKT signaling axis by pertussis toxin or the C311A/C314A/L351A mutation in the C-terminus of LPA2 abrogated the effect of LPA on DNA repair. LPA2 transcripts in Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) enriched for bone marrow stem cells were 27- and 5-fold higher than in common myeloid or lymphoid progenitors, respectively. Furthermore, after irradiation higher residual \u03b3-H2AX levels were detected in the bone marrow or jejunum of irradiated LPA2-KO mice compared to WT mice. We found that \u03b3-irradiation increases plasma ATX activity and LPA level that is in part due to the previously established radiation-induced upregulation of TNF\u03b1.

Due to the lack of tissue samples from early-stages of PC, the stage-specific alteration of miRNAs during PC initiation and progression is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the global miRNA expression profile and their processing machinery during PC progression using the KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mouse model. At 25 weeks, the miRNA microarray analysis revealed significant downregulation of miR-150, miR-494, miR-138, miR-148a, miR-216a, and miR-217 and upregulation of miR-146b, miR-205, miR-31, miR-192, and miR-21 in KC mice compared to controls. Further, expression of miRNA biosynthetic machinery including Dicer, Exportin-5, TRKRA, and TARBP2 were downregulated, while DGCR8 and Ago2 were upregulated in KC mice.

After 5 days, muscle weights and ex vivo [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake were assessed. Overload-induced muscle glucose uptake and hypertrophic growth were not impaired in muscle-specific GLUT4 knockout mice, demonstrating that GLUT4 is not necessary for these processes. To assess which transporters mediate overload-induced glucose uptake, chemical inhibitors were used. The facilitative GLUT inhibitor cytochalasin B, but not the sodium-dependent glucose cotransport inhibitor phloridzin, prevented overload-induced uptake demonstrating that GLUTs mediate this effect. To assess which GLUT, hexose competition experiments were performed. Overload-induced [3H]-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was not inhibited by d-fructose, demonstrating that the fructose-transporting GLUT2, GLUT5, GLUT8, and GLUT12 do not mediate this effect. To assess additional GLUTs, immunoblots were performed. Overload increased GLUT1, GLUT3, GLUT6, and GLUT10 protein levels twofold to fivefold.

APP/PS1 mice and KCa3.1-/-/APP/PS1 mice were subjected to Morris water maze test to evaluate the spatial memory deficits. Glia activation and neuron loss was measured by immunostaining. Fluo-4AM was used to measure cytosolic Ca2+ level in \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) induced reactive astrocytes in vitro. KCa3.1 expression was markedly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) in both A\u03b2-stimulated primary astrocytes and brain lysates of AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mice. The KCa3.1 channel was shown to regulate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) through an interaction with the Ca2+ channel Orai1 in primary astrocytes. Gene deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 protected against SOCE-induced Ca2+ overload and ER stress via the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in astrocytes. Importantly, gene deletion or blockade of KCa3.1 restored AKT/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling both in vivo and in vitro.

{"title": "Lack of major involvement of human uroplakin genes in vesicoureteral reflux: implications for disease heterogeneity.", "abstract": "Primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a hereditary disorder characterized by the retrograde flow of urine into the ureters and kidneys. It affects about 1% of the young children and is thus one of the most common hereditary diseases. Its associated nephropathy is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in children and adults. Recent studies indicate that genetic ablation of mouse uroplakin (UP) III gene, which encodes a 47 kD urothelial-specific integral membrane protein forming urothelial plaques, causes VUR and hydronephrosis. To begin to determine whether mutations in UP genes might play a role in human VUR, we genotyped all four UP genes in 76 patients with radiologically proven primary VUR by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of all their exons plus 50 to 150 bp of flanking intronic sequences. Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, seven of which were missense, with no truncation or frame shift mutations. Since healthy relatives of the VUR probands are not reliable negative controls for VUR, we used a population of 90 race-matched, healthy individuals, unrelated to the VUR patients, as controls to perform an association study. Most of the SNPs were not found to be significantly associated with VUR. However, SNP1 of UP Ia gene affecting a C to T conversion and an Ala7Val change, and SNP7 of UP III affecting a C to G conversion and a Pro154Ala change, were marginally associated with VUR (both P= 0.08). Studies of additional cases yielded a second set of data that, in combination with the first set, confirmed a weak association of UP III SNP7 in VUR (P= 0.036 adjusted for both subsets of cases vs. controls). Such a weak association and the lack of families with simple dominant Mendelian inheritance suggest that missense changes of uroplakin genes cannot play a dominant role in causing VUR in humans, although they may be weak risk factors contributing to a complex polygenic disease. The fact that no truncation or frame shift mutations have been found in any of the VUR patients, coupled with our recent finding that some breeding pairs of UP III knockout mice yield litters that show not only VUR, but also severe hydronephrosis and neonatal death, raises the possibility that major uroplakin mutations could be embryonically or postnatally lethal in humans.", "abstract_id": 15200408, "entities": [{"entity": "Uroplakin genes", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Vesicoureteral reflux", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms", "qualifier": ["in Uroplakin genes"]}, {"entity": "Vesicoureteral reflux", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Missense changes", "qualifier": ["in Uroplakin genes"]}, {"entity": "Vesicoureteral reflux", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Major uroplakin mutations", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Humans", "qualifier": null}]}

This association was substantiated by haplotype analysis of these and 2 additional SNPs (OR, 2.48; P = .004), and also by family-based tests for the allele and haplotype carrying 157delMTTTVP (P = .009 and P = .048, respectively). Furthermore, this association seems to exist even in the hepatitis A virus-seronegative subjects in our data. None of the 3 variants in TIM-3 genes yielded significant association with either asthma or asthma-related phenotypes.

{"title": "Two novel mutations in SRY gene form Chinese sex reversal XY females.", "abstract": "The SRY gene (sex determining region on Y chromosome) acts as TDF and is required for regulating male sex determination. SRY represents a transcription factor belonging to the superfamily of genes sharing the HMG-box motif (high-mobility group-box), which acts as DNA binding region. Deletion and inactivating mutations of SRY are among the known causes of XY sex reversal. Here, we described the screening of 10 patients who presented with 46,XY sex reversal for mutations in open reading frame (ORF) of SRY gene. DNA was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques. A 609 bp fragment from the central portion of the SRY gene was amplified, using primers XES-2 and XES-7. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into the pUCm-T vectors, and direct sequencing were carried out on an ABI 377-3 automated DNA sequencer to detect the mutation. PCR-restriction enzyme digestion was applied to detect the results of DNA sequencing. In two patients,de novo mutations led to an amino acid substitution. An A was replaced by a G in codon 38 upstream of the 5' border outside the HMG box of the SRY gene, resulting in the replacement of the amino acid glutamate by glycine. Another heterozygous T to A transition at the nucleotide position +387 which encodes for a Tyrosine (Tyr) instead of a Term, whereas her father was proven to have the wild-type sequence. These point mutations have been confirmed with PCR-restrict enzyme method. As demonstrated by the Human Gene Mutation Database analysis,homology search, and review of the literature, these two mutations were not described previously and brought the total number of SRY gene nucleotide substitutions (missense/nonsense) to 45. These findings indicated that these amino acid substitutions may be responsible for the sex reversal,not only inside the HMG-box but also outside the HMG-box. The two novel mutations in SRY gene provided valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanism of the patient with 46,XY female sex reversal.", "abstract_id": 16018252, "entities": [{"entity": "SRY gene", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Two novel mutations", "qualifier": ["Amino acid substitution"]}, {"entity": "Two patients", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "46,XY sex reversal", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Amino acid substitutions", "qualifier": ["SRY gene"]}, {"entity": "46,XY sex reversal", "qualifier": null}]}

Cloning of the full-length DOCK8 cDNA led us to define that the DOCK8 gene encodes a protein consisting of 2,099 amino acids. DOCK8 was expressed in a variety of human organs, including the lungs, and was also expressed in type II alveolar, bronchiolar epithelial and bronchial epithelial cells, which are considered as being progenitors for lung cancer cells. DOCK8 expression was reduced in 62/71 (87%) primary lung cancers compared with normal lung tissue, and the reduction occurred irrespective of the histological type of lung cancer. 5-Aza-2'-deoxy-cytidine and/or Trichostatin A treatments induced DOCK8 expression in lung cancer cell lines with reduced DOCK8 expression. Therefore, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, were indicated to be involved in DOCK8 down-regulation in lung cancer cells. Further screening revealed homozygous deletions of the DOCK8 gene in a gastric and a breast cancer cell line. DOCK family proteins have been shown to play roles in regulation of migration, morphology, adhesion and growth of cells.

The prostaglandins produced by COX-2 are involved in inflammation and pain response in different tissues in the body. Accumulating evidence from epidemiologic studies, chemical carcinogen-induced rodent models and clinical trials indicate that COX-2 plays a role in human carcinogenesis and is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissue. We examined whether sequence variants in the COX-2 gene are associated with prostate cancer risk. We analyzed a large population-based case-control study, cancer prostate in Sweden (CAPS) consisting of 1,378 cases and 782 controls. We evaluated 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the entire COX-2 gene in 94 subjects of the control group. Five SNPs had a minor allele frequency of more than 5% in our study population and these were genotyped in all case patients and control subjects and gene-specific haplotypes were constructed. A statistically significant difference in allele frequency between cases and controls was observed for 2 of the SNPs (+3100 T/G and +8365 C/T), with an odds ratio of 0.78 (95% CI=0.64-0.96) and 0.65 (95% CI=0.45-0.94) respectively.

On the 10th day of paroxetine and alprazolam treatment, the patient exhibited marked psychomotor retardation, disorientation, and severe muscle rigidity with tremors. The patient had a fever (38.2 degrees C), fluctuating blood pressure (between 165/90 and 130/70 mg mm Hg), and severe extrapyramidal symptoms.

{"title": "DNA damage and repair in gastric cancer--a correlation with the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes polymorphisms.", "abstract": "The cell's susceptibility to mutagens and its ability to repair DNA lesions are important for cancer induction, promotion and progression. Both the mutagens' sensitivity and the efficacy of DNA repair may be affected by variation in several genes, including DNA repair genes. The hOGG1 gene encodes glycosylase of base excision repair and RAD51 specifies a key protein in homologues recombination repair. Both can be involved in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions, which can contribute to stomach cancer. In the present work we determined the level of basal and oxidative DNA damage and the kinetics of removal of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 30 gastric cancer patients and 30 healthy individuals. The metrics from DNA damage and repair study were correlated with the genotypes of common polymorphisms of the hOGG1 and RAD51 genes: a G-->C transversion at 1245 position of the hOGG1 gene producing a Ser-->Cys substitution at the codon 326 (the Ser326Cys polymorphism) and a G-->C substitution at position 135 (5'-untranslated region) of the RAD51 gene (the G135C polymorphism). DNA damage and repair were evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) assisted by DNA repair enzymes: endonuclease III (Nth) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), preferentially recognizing oxidized DNA bases. The genotypes of the polymorphism were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR. We observed a strong association between gastric cancer occurrence, impaired DNA repair in human lymphocytes and the G/C genotype of the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene. Moreover, there was a strong correlation between that genotype and stomach cancer occurrence in subjects with high level of oxidatively damaged DNA. We did not observe any correlation between the Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene and gastric cancer, including subjects with impaired DNA repair and/or high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA lesions. Therefore, our result suggest that the G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene may be linked with gastric cancer by the modulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress and this polymorphism may be a useful additional marker in this disease along with the genetic or/and environmental indicators of oxidative stress.", "abstract_id": 16843501, "entities": [{"entity": "G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene", "qualifier": ["RAD51 gene"]}, {"entity": "gastric cancer", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Ser1245Cys polymorphism of the hOGG1 gene", "qualifier": ["hOGG1 gene"]}, {"entity": "gastric cancer", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "G135C polymorphism of the RAD51 gene", "qualifier": ["RAD51 gene"]}, {"entity": "DNA repair", "qualifier": ["in human lymphocytes"]}]}

In the current study, the haplotype structure of the PTPN22 region was determined, and individual haplotypes were tested for association with type 1 diabetes in family-based tests. The 1858T risk allele occurred on only a single haplotype that was strongly associated with type 1 diabetes (P = 7.9 x 10(-5)). After controlling for the effects of this allele, two other haplotypes were observed to be weakly associated with type 1 diabetes (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the coding region of PTPN22 on these haplotypes revealed a novel variant (2250G/C) predicted to result in a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution. Analysis of PTPN22 transcripts from a subject heterozygous for this variant indicated that it interfered with normal mRNA splicing, resulting in a premature termination codon after exon 17. These results support the conclusion that the 1858C/T allele is the major risk variant for type 1 diabetes in the PTPN22 locus, but they suggest that additional infrequent coding variants at PTPN22 may also contribute to type 1 diabetes risk.", "abstract_id": 17003357, "entities": [{"entity": "PTPN22", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Type 1 diabetes", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "1858C/T allele", "qualifier": ["PTPN22"]}, {"entity": "Type 1 diabetes", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "2250G/C variant", "qualifier": ["PTPN22"]}, {"entity": "mRNA splicing", "qualifier": null}]}

The normal (GCG)6(GCA)3GCG sequence was replaced by (GCG)6(GCA)(GCG)4(GCA)3GCG due to an insertion of (GCG)4GCA into the normal allele in the Taiwanese OPMD subjects. In contrast to a single GCG expansion in most of OPMD patients in the literature, an insertion of (GCG)4GCA in the PABPN1 gene was found in the Taiwanese OPMD subjects.

In blocking the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to isoprenaline, (+)-propranolol had less than one hundredth the potency of (-)-propranolol. At dose levels of (+)-propranolol which attenuated the responses to isoprenaline, there was a significant prolongation of the PR interval of the electrocardiogram.3. The metabolic responses to isoprenaline in dogs (an increase in circulating glucose, lactate and free fatty acids) were all blocked by (-)-propranolol. (+)-Propranolol had no effect on fatty acid mobilization but significantly reduced the increments in both lactate and glucose.4. Both isomers of propranolol possessed similar depressant potency on isolated atrial muscle taken from guinea-pigs.5. The isomers of propranolol exhibited similar local anaesthetic potencies on an isolated frog nerve preparation at a level approximately three times that of procaine. The racemic compound was significantly less potent than either isomer.6. Both isomers of propranolol were capable of preventing adrenaline-induced cardiac arrhythmias in cats anaesthetized with halothane, but the mean dose of (-)-propranolol was 0.09+/-0.02 mg/kg whereas that of (+)-propranolol was 4.2+/-1.2 mg/kg.

These Schwann cell lineage-derived sarcomas aggressively invade adjacent nerve and soft tissue, frequently precluding surgical resection. Little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior. We have shown that MPNSTs express neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) beta isoforms, which promote Schwann cell migration during development, and NRG-1 alpha isoforms, whose effects on Schwann cells are poorly understood. Hypothesizing that NRG-1 beta and/or NRG-1 alpha promote MPNST invasion, we found that NRG-1 beta promoted MPNST migration in a substrate-specific manner, markedly enhancing migration on laminin but not on collagen type I or fibronectin. The NRG-1 receptors erbB3 and erbB4 were present in MPNST invadopodia (processes mediating invasion), partially colocalized with focal adhesion kinase and the laminin receptor beta(1)-integrin and coimmunoprecipitated with beta(1)-integrin. NRG-1 beta stimulated human and murine MPNST cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner in three-dimensional migration assays, acting as a chemotactic factor. Both baseline and NRG-1 beta-induced migration were erbB-dependent and required the action of MEK 1/2, SAPK/JNK, PI-3 kinase, Src family kinases and ROCK-I/II. In contrast, NRG-1 alpha had no effect on the migration and invasion of some MPNST lines and inhibited the migration of others. While NRG-1 beta potently and persistently activated Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases, NRG-1 alpha did not activate Akt and activated these other kinases with kinetics distinct from those evident in NRG-1 beta-stimulated cells. These findings suggest that NRG-1 beta enhances MPNST migration and that NRG-1 beta and NRG-1 alpha differentially modulate this process.", "abstract_id": 19306381, "entities": [{"entity": "NRG-1 beta", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "MPNST migration", "qualifier": ["on laminin"]}, {"entity": "NRG-1 alpha", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "MPNST migration", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NRG-1 beta", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Erk 1/2, SAPK/JNK, Akt and Src family kinases", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NRG-1 alpha", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Akt", "qualifier": null}]}

To analyse the in vivo function of TAK1 in cartilage, we generated mice with a conditional deletion of Tak1 driven by the collagen 2 promoter. Tak1(col2) mice displayed severe chondrodysplasia with runting, impaired formation of secondary centres of ossification, and joint abnormalities including elbow dislocation and tarsal fusion. This phenotype resembled that of bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)1 and Gdf5-deficient mice.

TAK1 mediates Smad1 phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence in a mammalian system that TAK1 is required for BMP signalling and functions as an upstream activating kinase for Smad1/5/8 in addition to its known role in regulating MAP kinase pathways.

Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals. We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants, the sG145R and sP120T mutants, on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment-associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and/or HBeAg negativity. Replication-competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120T and LAM resistance (rtM204I or rtL180M/rtM204V) were generated on an HBeAg-positive and an HBeAg-negative background with precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutants. The sG145R mutation strongly reduced HBsAg levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of LAM-resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild-type HBV, and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication. Although the sP120T substitution also impaired HBsAg secretion, it did not enhance the replication of LAM-resistant clones. However, the concomitant occurrence of HBeAg negativity (PC/BCP), sP120T, and LAM resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild-type HBV. In all clones with combined immune escape and LAM resistance mutations, the nucleotide analogues adefovir and tenofovir remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro.

Recently, heterozygous REN mutations were shown to result in early-onset hyperuricemia, anemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). To date, only 3 different heterozygous REN mutations have been published.

On this basis, we conclude that REN mutations are rare events in patients with CKD.

Maleate-induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl \u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), upregulation of kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels. Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups. Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture.

We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms. Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured the cell survival rate, relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-\u03b1 related to NSP administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proteins related to the NF-\u03baB, ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt pathways were investigated by Western blotting. To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-\u03baB pathway, a NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection. We found that NSP significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. It also reduced NO/TNF-\u03b1 release. Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKB\u03b1/\u03b2 and P65 were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration. The NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-\u03baB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by NSP administration. Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes.

An important recent study has also shown that the initial toxicity produced by paclitaxel in patients was highly predictive of long-term outcome. In this study, we therefore focused on defining the mechanisms of acute toxicity produced by paclitaxel treatment on primary sensory neurons under in vitro conditions. In primary rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) culture with paclitaxel, an increase of pERK and pp38 was observed at 2 hours, and this was accompanied by an increase in expression and release of C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). There was no change in pJNK. The increase in pERK was sustained at 48 hours of exposure when the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and IL-6 was also increased. IL-6 and CCL2 were colocalized to TLR4-positive cells, and all these responses were prevented by coincubation with a TLR4 antagonist (LPS-RS). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that DRG neurons developed spontaneous depolarizing fluctuations (DSFs) in membrane potential and hyperexcitability to current injection but no ectopic action potential activity at 24 and 48 hours of paclitaxel incubation. However, CCL2 applied to cultured neurons not only induced DSFs but also evoked action potentials. Evidence of oxidative stress and mitotoxicity was observed at 48 hours of exposure.

Neuropathic pain was induced by intraperitoneal injection of paclitaxel (PAC) on four alternate days in male Sprague-Dawley rats or male Axin2-LacZ knock-in mice. XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin blockers, were administered intraperitoneally as a single or multiple doses before or after injury. Mechanical allodynia, phosphoproteome profiling, Wnt ligands, and inflammatory mediators were measured by von Frey filament, phosphoproteomics, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis. Localization of \u03b2-catenin was determined by immunohistochemical analysis in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) in rats and human. Our phosphoproteome profiling of CINP rats revealed significant phosphorylation changes in Wnt signaling components. Importantly, repeated systemic injections of XAV-939 or LGK-974 prevented the development of CINP in rats. In addition, XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14 ameliorated CINP. PAC increased Wnt3a and Wnt10a, activated \u03b2-catenin in DRG, and increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 in DRG. PAC also upregulated rAxin2 in mice. Furthermore, \u03b2-catenin was expressed in neurons, including calcitonin gene-related protein-expressing neurons and satellite cells in rat and human DRG. In conclusion, chemotherapy increases Wnt3a, Wnt10a, and \u03b2-catenin in DRG and their pharmacological blockers prevent and ameliorate CINP, suggesting a target for the prevention and treatment of CINP.", "abstract_id": 33128175, "entities": [{"entity": "Chemotherapy", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CINP", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Paclitaxel (PAC)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Wnt3a, Wnt10a, and \u03b2-Catenin", "qualifier": ["in DRG"]}, {"entity": "XAV-939, LGK-974, and iCRT14", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CINP", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "\u03b2-Catenin", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "neurons and satellite cells in DRG", "qualifier": null}]}

From regulating homeostasis to conducting phagocytosis, and from inducing inflammation to resolving it, macrophages are plastic cells that are highly adaptable to their environment. They rely on communicating with the environment through cytokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, and other signals to respond to inflammation or injury. The contribution of macrophages to OA joint damage has garnered much attention in recent years. Here, we discuss how macrophages may participate in the initiation and maintenance of pain in OA.

Of particular concern is the prevalence of opioid use among emerging adults (ages 18-25), as this is a developmental period of heightened vulnerability and critical social, neurological, and psychological development. Data from 2015 show that American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have the highest rates of diagnosis for opioid use disorders (OUDs). One recent study found that the overdose death rate among urban-dwelling AI/AN individuals was 1.4 times higher compared to those living in rural areas. To date, there are no evidence-based prevention programs addressing opioid use among urban AI/AN emerging adults that integrate culturally-appropriate strategies with evidence-based treatment. Traditions and Connections for Urban Native Americans (TACUNA) builds on our prior work with AI/AN communities across California to develop and evaluate culturally appropriate programming to address opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use among urban AI/AN emerging adults. In a randomized controlled trial, 18-25\u00a0year old urban AI/AN emerging adults will receive either TACUNA (n\u2009=\u2009185), which comprises three virtual workshops utilizing motivational interviewing, social network visualization, and integrating traditional practices and a wellness circle, or one virtual culturally sensitive opioid education workshop (n\u2009=\u2009185). We will evaluate intervention effects on primary outcomes of frequency of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use, as well as secondary outcomes of social network characteristics and cultural connectedness, over a 12-month period. This project has the potential to expand the range and effectiveness of opioid, alcohol, and cannabis services for urban AI/AN emerging adults by addressing the opioid epidemic and use of other substances at both the community and individual level. In addition, it provides important culturally grounded conceptual and practical information to advance the field of substance use interventions and enhance resiliency among this population.

{"title": "Assessing the Relative Effectiveness of Combining Self-Care with Practitioner-Delivered Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies to Improve Pain in a Pragmatic Trial.", "abstract": "Many health care systems are beginning to encourage patients to use complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies for pain management. Many clinicians have anecdotally reported that patients combining self-care CIH therapies with practitioner-delivered therapies report larger health improvements than do patients using practitioner-delivered or self-care CIH therapies alone. However, we are unaware of any trials in this area. The APPROACH Study (Assessing Pain, Patient-Reported Outcomes and Complementary and Integrative Health) assesses the value of veterans participating in practitioner-delivered CIH therapies alone or self-care CIH therapies alone compared with the combination of self-care and practitioner-delivered care. The study is being conducted in 18 Veterans Health Administration sites that received funding as part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to expand availability of CIH therapies. Practitioner-delivered therapies under study include chiropractic care, acupuncture, and therapeutic massage, and self-care therapies include tai chi/qi gong, yoga, and meditation. The primary outcome will be improvement on the Brief Pain Inventory 6\u2009months after initiation of CIH as compared with baseline scores.

This study assesses the prevalence of co-occurring substance use in West Virginia (WV) to inform treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of, and demographic and clinical characteristics (including age, gender, hepatitis C virus (HCV) status) associated with, co-occurring substance use among patients with OUD in WV. This retrospective study utilized the West Virginia Clinical and Translation Science Institute Integrated Data Repository, comprised of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from West Virginia University Medicine. Deidentified data were extracted from inpatient psychiatric admissions and emergency department (ED) healthcare encounters between 2009 and 2018. Eligible patients were those with OUD who had a positive urine toxicology screen for opioids at the time of their initial encounter with the healthcare system. Extracted data included results of comprehensive urine toxicology testing during the study timeframe. 3,127 patients met the inclusion criteria of whom 72.8% had co-occurring substance use. Of those who were positive for opioids and at least one additional substance, benzodiazepines were the most common co-occurring substances (57.4% of patients yielded a positive urine toxicology screen for both substances), followed by cannabis (53.1%), cocaine (24.5%) and amphetamine (21.6%). Individuals who used co-occurring substances were younger than those who were positive for opioids alone (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There was a higher prevalence of individuals who used co-occurring substances that were HCV positive in comparison to those who used opioids alone (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There were limited gender differences noted between individuals who used co-occurring substances and those who used opioids alone. Among ED admissions who were positive for opioids, 264 were diagnosed with substance toxicity/overdose, 78.4% of whom had co-occurring substance use (benzodiazepines: 65.2%; cannabis: 44.4%; cocaine: 28.5%; amphetamine: 15.5%). Across the 10-year timespan, the greatest increase for the entire sample was in the rate of co-occurring amphetamine and opioid use (from 12.6% in 2014 to 47.8% in 2018).

{"title": "A Qualitative Study of Patient Protection against Postoperative Opioid Addiction: A Thematic Analysis of Self-Agency.", "abstract": "Opioids are commonly used following outpatient surgery. However, we understand little about patients' perspectives and how patients decide on postoperative opioid use. This study seeks to investigate aspects of patients' thought processes that most impact their decisions. The authors conducted semistructured interviews with 30 adults undergoing minor elective hand surgery at one tertiary hospital. Narratives were content-coded to arrive at the authors' thematic analysis. The authors incorporated Bandura's concept of self-agency to interpret the data and develop a conceptual framework that best explained the implicit theory within participants' responses. The authors found six themes under two domains of self-agency. Participants actively sought out protective mechanisms supporting their decision on opioid use, but sometimes did so unconsciously. They would avoid opioids postoperatively because they were \"tough\" and wanted to evade the risk of addiction as \"good citizens.\" They conveyed a nuanced safety against addiction because they were \"not the kind\" to become addicted and because they trusted the surgeons' prescribing. However, participants felt discouraged by the stigma associated with opioids. Both intentionally and unintentionally, participants integrated a strong sense of self in their decision-making processes. A robust understanding of how patients choose to take opioids for postoperative pain control is imperative to develop patient-centered strategies to treat the opioid epidemic. Effective opioid-reduction policies should consider patients as active agents who negotiate various internal and external influences in their decision-making processes. Surgeons must incorporate patients' individual goals and perspectives regarding postoperative opioid use to minimize opioid-related harm after surgery.", "abstract_id": 33890894, "entities": []}

This qualitative study explores how adolescents manage pain, including how decision making with parents and providers affect their experience with opioid and non-opioid analgesics after third molar dental extractions. We used a qualitative approach for the analysis of 30 telephone-based semi-structured interviews completed by 15 dyads between May and August 2019, which included 15 adolescents (15-17\u00a0years) who underwent a dental extraction, and a parent or guardian for each adolescent. The total sample included 30 participants. Interviews were conducted separately for patients and parents. De-identified interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative analysis software using a directed content analysis approach. A total of 15 patient/parent dyads were interviewed. Key themes associated with pain management included sources of information, pain management behaviors engaged in by the adolescents and their caregivers, and the use of medication. In addition to conversations with their dental provider, most patients and their parents discussed pain management plans that included non-medication options, over-the-counter medications, and opioid medications to be taken as needed, which guided their post-extraction behaviors. All participants reported that the adolescent received an opioid prescription for post-extraction pain management, to be taken on an \"as needed\" basis, but most only took it the day of the extraction and up to 2\u00a0days following, usually based on the patient's reported pain levels and perceptions of over-the-counter medication adequacy. Participants said they did not receive guidance from their provider concerning disposal of unused opioid medications. Involving adolescents in the pain management decision making process and allowing them to carry out the plan with some caregiver support was acceptable and well executed following third molar extractions. Providers may have an opportunity to reduce the number of opioids prescribed, since respondents reported little to no use of opioids that they were prescribed.

Multilevel models examined the effects of MORE on craving, pain, and affect, as well as the association between positive affect and craving. EMA showed significantly greater improvements in craving, pain unpleasantness, stress, and positive affect for participants in MORE than for participants in TAU. Participants in MORE reported having nearly 1.3 times greater self-control over craving than those in TAU. Further, positive affect was associated with reduced craving, an association that was significantly stronger among participants in MORE than TAU.

Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knock-out mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4-). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4- dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4+). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knock-out mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors, whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knock-out DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK.

However, individuals show considerable vulnerability to the development of chronic pain under similar pain conditions. In this study on male rat and mouse models of chronic neuropathic pain, we identify the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in central amygdala as a key epigenetic regulator that controls the development of comorbid emotional disorders underlying the individual vulnerability to chronic pain. We found that animals that were vulnerable to developing behaviors of anxiety and depression under the pain condition displayed reduced SIRT1 protein levels in central amygdala, but not those animals resistant to the emotional disorders. Viral overexpression of local SIRT1 reversed this vulnerability, but viral knockdown of local SIRT1 mimicked the pain effect, eliciting the pain vulnerability in pain-free animals. The SIRT1 action was associated with CaMKII\u03b1 downregulation and deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 at the CaMKII\u03b1 promoter. These results suggest that, by transcriptional repression of CaMKII\u03b1 in central amygdala, SIRT1 functions to guard against the emotional pain vulnerability under chronic pain conditions. This study indicates that SIRT1 may serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for individualized treatment of chronic pain with vulnerable emotional disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Chronic pain is a prevalent neurological disease with no effective treatment at present. Pain patients display considerably variable vulnerability to developing chronic pain, indicating individual-based molecular mechanisms underlying the pain vulnerability, which is hardly addressed in current preclinical research. In this study, we have identified the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as a key regulator that controls this pain vulnerability. This study reveals that the SIRT1-CaMKIIa\u03b1 pathway in central amygdala acts as an epigenetic mechanism that guards against the development of comorbid emotional disorders under chronic pain, and that its dysfunction causes increased vulnerability to the development of chronic pain.

We developed the operant plantar thermal assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task requiring evaluation and active decision-making to obtain reward under thermally aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures, male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA. Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition, compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced thermal pain tolerance.

We observed that: 1) IgM protein levels in the skin of the fractured mice were elevated at 3\u00a0weeks post fracture, but not at earlier time points, 2) serum from fracture mice at 3\u00a0weeks, but not 1 and 2\u00a0weeks post fracture, had pro-nociceptive effects when passively transferred to fractured muMT mice lacking B cells, 3) fracture induced popliteal lymphadenopathy occurred ipsilateral to fracture beginning at 1\u00a0week and peaking at 3\u00a0weeks post fracture, 4) a germinal center reaction was detected by FACS analysis in the popliteal lymph nodes from injured limbs by 3\u00a0weeks post fracture but not in other lymphoid tissues, 5) germinal center formation was characterized by the induction of T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and germinal center B cells in the popliteal lymph nodes of the injured but not contralateral limbs, and 6) fracture mice treated with the Tfh signaling inhibitor FK506 had impaired germinal center reactions, reduced IgM levels, reduced nociceptive sensitization, and no pronociceptive serum effects after administration to fractured muMT mice.

{"title": "Dimethyl Fumarate Reduces Oxidative Stress and Pronociceptive Immune Responses in a Murine Model of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.", "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a highly disabling cause of pain often precipitated by surgery or trauma to a limb. Both innate and adaptive immunological changes contribute to this syndrome. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) works through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor and other targets to activate antioxidant systems and to suppress immune system activation. We hypothesized that DMF would reduce nociceptive, functional, and immunological changes measured in a model of CRPS. Male C57BL/6 mice were used in the well-characterized tibial fracture model of CRPS. Some groups of mice received DMF 25 mg/kg/d orally, per os for 3 weeks after fracture versus vehicle alone. Homozygous Nrf2 null mutant mice were used as test subjects to address the need for this transcription factor for DMF activity. Allodynia was assessed using von Frey filaments and hindlimb weight-bearing data were collected. The markers of oxidative stress malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were quantified in the skin of the fractured mice using immunoassays along with the innate immune system cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. The accumulation of IgM in the fractured limbs and lymph node hypertrophy were used as indexes of adaptive immune system activation, and the passive transfer of serum from wildtype fractured mice to B cell-deficient fractured muMT mice (mice lacking B cells and immunoglobulin) helped to assess the pronociceptive activity of humoral factors. We observed that oral DMF administration strongly prevented nociceptive sensitization and reduced uneven hindlimb weight bearing after fracture. DMF was also very effective in reducing the accumulation of markers of oxidative stress, activation of innate immune mediator production, lymph node hypertrophy, and the accumulation of IgM in fractured limbs. The sera of fractured vehicle-treated but not DMF-treated mice conferred pronociceptive activity to recipient mice. Unexpectedly, the effects of DMF were largely unchanged in the Nrf2 null mutant mice. Oxidative stress and immune system activation are robust after hindlimb fracture in mice. DMF strongly reduces activation of those systems, and the Nrf2 transcription factor is not required. DMF or drugs working through similar mechanisms might provide effective therapy for CRPS or other conditions where oxidative stress causes immune system activation.", "abstract_id": 33646995, "entities": [{"entity": "Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "DMF", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Oxidative stress", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "DMF", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Innate immune system", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "DMF", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Nrf2", "qualifier": null}]}

Previous studies indicate that the immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells modulate the magnitude of punctate mechanical allodynia resulting from sciatic nerve injury. However, whether enhancing Treg-mediated suppression attenuates dynamic allodynia is not known. In the present study, we addressed this knowledge gap by treating mice with low-dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL2) injections or adoptive transfer of Treg cells. Female Swiss Webster mice received daily injections of ld-IL2 (1 \u03bcg/mouse, intraperitoneally) either before or after unilateral spared nerve injury (SNI). Male C57BL/6J mice received adoptive transfer of 1 x 106 Treg cells 3 weeks post-SNI. The responses to punctate and dynamic mechanical stimuli on the hindpaw were monitored before and up to 4-6 weeks post-SNI. We also compared the distribution of Treg cells and CD3+ total T cells after SNI and/or ld-IL2 treatment. Ld-IL2 pretreatment in female Swiss Webster mice completely blocked the development of SNI-induced dynamic mechanical allodynia and reduced the magnitude of punctate allodynia. Delayed ld-IL2 treatment in female mice significantly attenuated the morphine-resistant punctate and dynamic allodynia at 3-5 weeks post-SNI. Adoptive transfer of Treg cells to male C57BL/6J mice 3 weeks post-SNI effectively reversed the persistent punctate and dynamic allodynia, supporting that the effect of ld-IL2 is mediated through endogenous Treg cells, and is likely independent of mouse strain and sex. Neither ld-IL2 treatment nor Treg transfer affected the basal responses to punctate or brush stimuli. Ld-IL2 significantly increased the frequency of Treg cells among total CD3+ T cells in the injured sciatic nerves but not in the uninjured nerves or the dorsal root ganglia, suggesting the injured nerve as ld-IL2's site of action. Collectively, results from the present study supports Treg as a cellular target and ld-IL2 as a potential therapeutic option for nerve injury-induced persistent punctate and dynamic mechanical allodynia.", "abstract_id": 33854366, "entities": [{"entity": "Interleukin-2", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Mechanical Allodynia", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Regulatory T cells", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Mechanical Allodynia", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Adoptive Transfer", "qualifier": ["of Regulatory T cells"]}, {"entity": "Mechanical Allodynia", "qualifier": null}]}

Some neuropathic pain conditions and preclinical neuropathic pain behaviors are improved by sympathetic blockade. In this study, we examined the effect of a localized \"microsympathectomy,\" ie, cutting the gray rami containing sympathetic postganglionic axons where they enter the L4 and L5 spinal nerves, which is more analogous to clinically used sympathetic blockade compared with chemical or surgical sympathectomy. We also examined manipulations of CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), a key player in both regeneration and pain. We used rat tibial nerve crush as a neuropathic pain model in which peripheral nerve regeneration can occur successfully. CCL2 in the sensory ganglia was increased by tibial nerve crush and reduced by microsympathectomy. Microsympathectomy and localized siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCL2 in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion had very similar effects: partial improvement of mechanical hypersensitivity and guarding behavior, reduction of regeneration markers growth-associated protein 43 and activating transcription factor 3, and reduction of macrophage density in the sensory ganglia and regenerating nerve. Microsympathectomy reduced functional regeneration as measured by myelinated action potential propagation through the injury site and denervation-induced atrophy of the tibial-innervated gastrocnemius muscle at day 10. Microsympathectomy plus CCL2 knockdown had behavioral effects similar to microsympathectomy alone.

RNA N6-methyladenosine modification is an additional layer of gene regulation. Whether FTO (fat-mass and obesity-associated protein), an N6-methyladenosine demethylase, participates in hemorrhage-induced thalamic pain is unknown. Expression of Fto mRNA and protein was assessed in mouse thalamus after hemorrhage caused by microinjection of Coll IV (type IV collagenase) into unilateral thalamus. Effect of intraperitoneal administration of meclofenamic acid (a FTO inhibitor) or microinjection of adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5) expressing Cre into the thalamus of Ftofl/fl mice on the Coll IV microinjection\u2013induced TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) upregulation and nociceptive hypersensitivity was examined. Effect of thalamic microinjection of AAV5 expressing Fto (AAV5-Fto) on basal thalamic TLR4 expression and nociceptive thresholds was also analyzed. Additionally, level of N6-methyladenosine in Tlr4 mRNA and its binding to FTO or YTHDF2 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2) were observed. FTO was detected in neuronal nuclei of thalamus. Level of FTO protein, but not mRNA, was time-dependently increased in the ipsilateral thalamus on days 1 to 14 after Coll IV microinjection. Intraperitoneal injection of meclofenamic acid or adeno-associated virus-5 expressing Cre microinjection into Ftofl/fl mouse thalamus attenuated the Coll IV microinjection\u2013induced TLR4 upregulation and tissue damage in the ipsilateral thalamus and development and maintenance of nociceptive hypersensitivities on the contralateral side. Thalamic microinjection of AAV5-Fto increased TLR4 expression and elicited hypersensitivities to mechanical, heat and cold stimuli. Mechanistically, Coll IV microinjection produced an increase in FTO binding to Tlr4 mRNA, an FTO-dependent loss of N6-methyladenosine sites in Tlr4 mRNA and a reduction in the binding of YTHDF2 to Tlr4 mRNA in the ipsilateral thalamus.

Here, we identified trigeminal (TG) sensory neuronal subtypes (MM TG neurons) innervating MM fibers, masseteric fascia, tendons, and adjusted tissues. A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on TG neurons back-traced from reporter mouse MM found nine distinct subtypes of MM TG neurons. Of these neurons, 24% belonged to non-peptidergic IB-4+/TRPA1- or IB-4+/TRPA1+ groups, while two TRPV1+ small-sized neuronal groups were classified as peptidergic/CGRP+ One small-sized CGRP+ neuronal group had a unique electrophysiological profile and were recorded from Nav1.8- or trkC+ neurons. The remaining CGRP+ neurons were medium-sized, could be divided into Nav1.8-/trkC- and Nav1.8low/trkC+ clusters, and showed large 5HT-induced current. The final two MM TG neuronal groups were trkC+ and had no Nav1.8 and CGRP.

{"title": "Duration of Reduction in Enduring Stress-Induced Hyperalgesia Via FKBP51 Inhibition Depends on Timing of Administration Relative to Traumatic Stress Exposure.", "abstract": "Chronic pain development is a frequent outcome of severe stressor exposure, with or without tissue injury. Enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH) is believed to play a central role, but the precise mechanisms mediating the development of chronic post-traumatic pain, and the time-dependency of these mechanisms, remain poorly understood. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), a key stress system regulator, might prevent ESIH. We evaluated whether peritraumatic inhibition of FKBP51 in an animal model of traumatic stress exposure, the single prolonged stress (SPS) model, reversed ESIH evaluated via daily mechanical von Frey testing. FKBP51 inhibition was achieved using SAFit2, a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of FKBP51, administered to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats via intraperitoneal injection. To assess timing effects, FKBP51 was administered at different times relative to stress (SPS) exposure. SAFit2 administration immediately after SPS produced a complete reversal in ESIH lasting >7 days. In contrast, SAFit2 administration 72 hours following SPS produced only temporary hyperalgesia reversal, and administration 120h following SPS had no effect. Similarly, animals undergoing SPS together with tissue injury (plantar incision) receiving SAFit2 immediately post-surgery developed acute hyperalgesia but recovered by 4 days and did not develop ESIH. These data suggest that: 1) FKBP51 plays an important, time-dependent role in ESIH pathogenesis, 2) time windows of opportunity may exist to prevent ESIH via FKBP51 inhibition after traumatic stress, with or without tissue injury, and 3) the use of inhibitors of specific pathways may provide new insights into chronic post-traumatic pain development. PERSPECTIVE: The current work adds to a growing body of literature indicating that FKBP51 inhibition is a highly promising potential treatment strategy for reducing hyperalgesia. In the case of post-traumatic chronic pain, we show that such a treatment strategy would be particularly impactful if administered early after traumatic stress exposure.", "abstract_id": 35296422, "entities": [{"entity": "FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "SAFit2", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "SAFit2", "qualifier": ["immediate administration"]}, {"entity": "Enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "SAFit2", "qualifier": ["administration 72 hours post-stress"]}, {"entity": "Enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "SAFit2", "qualifier": ["administration 120 hours post-stress"]}, {"entity": "Enduring stress-induced hyperalgesia (ESIH)", "qualifier": null}]}

We found that human HNSCC tumors and mouse tumor tissue are innervated by peripheral sympathetic and sensory nerves. Moreover, \u03b2-adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors (\u03b2-ARs) are overexpressed in human oral cancer cell lines, and norepinephrine treatment increased \u03b2-AR2 protein expression as well as cancer cell proliferation in vitro. We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) signaling reduces oral cancer-induced nociceptive behavior. Norepinephrine-treated cancer cell lines secrete more TNF\u03b1 which, when applied to tongue-innervating trigeminal neurons, evoked a larger Ca 2+ transient; TNF-TNFR inhibitor blocked the increase in the evoked Ca 2+ transient. Using an orthotopic xenograft oral cancer model, we found that mice demonstrated significantly less orofacial cancer-induced nociceptive behavior during systemic \u03b2-adrenergic inhibitory treatment with propranolol. Furthermore, chemical sympathectomy using guanethidine led to a significant reduction in tumor size and nociceptive behavior.

The most common treatments were buprenorphine maintenance (27%-35%) and mutual-help group attendance (27%-30%), followed by outpatient counseling (18%-23%) and methadone maintenance (4%). In adjusted analyses, current opioid agonist treatment showed the strongest association with current opioid abstinence (odds ratios [ORs] = 5.4, 4.6, and 2.8 at the 3 assessments), followed by current mutual-help attendance (ORs = 2.2, 2.7, and 1.9); current outpatient counseling was not significantly associated with abstinence in the adjusted models. While opioid agonist treatment was most strongly associated with opioid abstinence among patients with prescription opioid dependence over time, mutual-help group attendance was independently associated with opioid abstinence. Clinicians should consider recommending both of these interventions to patients with opioid use disorder.

{"title": "Pharmacists' attitudes toward dispensing naloxone and medications for opioid use disorder: A scoping review of the literature.", "abstract": "Background: Pharmacists are on the frontline caring for patients at risk of an opioid overdose and for patients with an opioid use disorder (OUD). Dispensing naloxone and medications for OUD and counseling patients about these medications are ways pharmacists can provide care. Key to pharmacists' involvement is their willingness to take on these practice responsibilities. Methods: The purpose of this scoping review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize published literature describing pharmacists' attitudes toward naloxone and medications for OUD, i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. All searches were performed on December 7, 2018, in 5 databases: Embase.com, PubMed.gov, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Wiley, and Clarivate Web of Science. Articles included original research conducted in the United States, described attitude-related language toward naloxone and medications for OUD, and pharmacists. Results: A total of 1323 articles were retrieved, 7 were included. Five studies reported on pharmacists' attitudes toward naloxone dispensing, 1 study reported on attitudes toward naloxone, buprenorphine, and buprenorphine/naloxone, and 1 reported on attitudes toward buprenorphine/naloxone. Respondents were diverse, including pharmacists from different practice specialties. Studies found that pharmacists agreed with a naloxone standing order, believed that naloxone should be dispensed to individuals at risk of an opioid overdose, and were supportive of dispensing buprenorphine. A minority of pharmacists expressed negative attitudes. Barriers cited to implementation included education and training, workflow, and management support. Conclusions: Pharmacists were positive in their attitudes toward increased practice responsibilities for patients at risk of an opioid overdose or with an OUD. Pharmacists must receive education and training to be current in their understanding of OUD medications, and they must be supported in order to provide effective care to this patient population.", "abstract_id": 31418645, "entities": [{"entity": "Pharmacists", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Naloxone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pharmacists", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Buprenorphine", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pharmacists", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid use disorder (OUD)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pharmacists", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid overdose", "qualifier": null}]}

To inform strategies for reducing the PO epidemic, research is needed on the sources of misused POs and their association with POUD. Methods: Past-year PO misusers aged \u226512 (N\u2009=\u20096033) from the 2015 to 2016 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health were analyzed. The most recent source of misused POs was assessed. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between the sources of misused POs and past-year POUD. All analyses were stratified by age groups for each sex. Results: Overall, the most common sources of misused POs were obtaining from friends/relatives for free (40.27%) and physicians (36.59%). Males had a higher prevalence of buying POs from friends/relatives or drug dealers/strangers than females. Significant age differences also emerged. Buying POs from drug dealers/strangers (vs. obtaining POs free from friends/relatives) was strong predictor of past-year POUD in both sexes. In the sex- and age-stratified analyses, significant associations of past-year POUD with (1) buying from drug dealers/strangers emerged among males aged 18+ and females aged 26+; (2) buying from friends/relatives emerged among males aged 12+ and females aged 18-25; (3) obtaining from physicians emerged among males aged 18+ and females aged 26+. Conclusions: Our findings indicate different risk profiles for POUD across sex and age groups with different diversion sources.

{"title": "Depression history as a predictor of outcomes during buprenorphine-naloxone treatment of prescription opioid use disorder.", "abstract": "In the multi-site Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study (POATS), the best predictor of successful opioid use outcome was lifetime diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The primary aim of this secondary analysis of data from POATS was to empirically assess two explanations for this counterintuitive finding. The POATS study was a national, 10-site randomized controlled trial (N = 360 enrolled in the 12-week buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance treatment phase) sponsored by the NIDA Clinical Trials Network. We evaluated how the presence of a history of depression influences opioid use outcome (negative urine drug assays). Using adjusted logistic regression models, we tested the hypotheses that 1) a reduction in depressive symptoms and 2) greater motivation and engagement in treatment account for the association between depression history and good treatment outcome. Although depressive symptoms decreased significantly throughout treatment (p <.001), this improvement was not associated with opioid outcomes (aOR = 0.98, ns). Reporting a goal of opioid abstinence at treatment entry was also not associated with outcomes (aOR = 1.39, ns); however, mutual-help group participation was associated with good treatment outcomes (aOR = 1.67, p <.05). In each of these models, lifetime major depressive disorder remained associated with good outcomes (aORs = 1.63-1.82, ps = .01-.055). Findings are consistent with the premise that greater engagement in treatment is associated with good opioid outcomes. Nevertheless, depression history continues to be associated with good opioid outcomes in adjusted models.

This article presents the outcomes of phases 3 and 4 of a 4-phase quality improvement, implementation feasibility study in which researchers worked with stakeholders at 6 primary care clinics in 2 large urban academic health care systems to define and implement their optimal screening approach. Site A was located in New York City and comprised 2 clinics, and site B was located in Boston, Massachusetts, and comprised 4 clinics. Clinics initiated screening between January 2017 and October 2018, and 93\u202f114 patients were eligible for screening for alcohol and drug use. Data used in the analysis were collected between January 2017 and October 2019, and analysis was performed from July 13, 2018, to March 23, 2021. Clinics integrated validated screening questions and a brief counseling script into the EHR, with implementation supported by the use of clinical champions (ie, clinicians who advocate for change, motivate others, and use their expertise to facilitate the adoption of an intervention) and the training of clinic staff. Clinics varied in their screening approaches, including the type of visit targeted for screening (any visit vs annual examinations only), the mode of administration (staff-administered vs self-administered by the patient), and the extent to which they used practice facilitation and EHR usability testing. Data from the EHRs were extracted quarterly for 12 months to measure implementation outcomes. The primary outcome was screening rate for alcohol and drug use. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of unhealthy alcohol and drug use detected via screening, and clinician adoption of a brief counseling script. Patients of the 6 clinics had a mean (SD) age ranging from 48.9 (17.3) years at clinic B2 to 59.1 (16.7) years at clinic B3, were predominantly female (52.4% at clinic A1 to 64.6% at clinic A2), and were English speaking. Racial diversity varied by location. Of the 93,114 patients with primary care visits, 71.8% received screening for alcohol use, and 70.5% received screening for drug use. Screening at any visit (implemented at site A) in comparison with screening at annual examinations only (implemented at site B) was associated with higher screening rates for alcohol use (90.3%-94.7% vs 24.2%-72.0%, respectively) and drug use (89.6%-93.9% vs 24.6%-69.8%). The 5 clinics that used a self-administered screening approach had a higher detection rate for moderate- to high-risk alcohol use (14.7%-36.6%) compared with the 1 clinic that used a staff-administered screening approach (1.6%). The detection of moderate- to high-risk drug use was low across all clinics (0.5%-1.0%). Clinics with more robust practice facilitation and EHR usability testing had somewhat greater adoption of the counseling script for patients with moderate-high risk alcohol or drug use (1.4%-12.5% vs 0.1%-1.1%). In this quality improvement study, EHR-integrated screening was feasible to implement in all clinics and unhealthy alcohol use was detected more frequently when self-administered screening was used at any primary care visit. The detection of drug use was low at all clinics, as was clinician adoption of counseling. These findings can be used to inform the decision-making of health care systems that are seeking to implement screening for substance use.

Mitragynine, its primary alkaloid constituent, is an opioid receptor ligand. However, the extent to which the in vivo effects of mitragynine are mediated by opioid receptors, or whether mitragynine interacts with other opioid agonists, is not fully established. The effects of mitragynine and the prototypical opioid agonist morphine were compared for their capacity to decrease operant responding for food delivery, and to increase response latency to a thermal stimulus. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats responded under a multiple cycle fixed ratio 10 schedule of food delivery and were tested on a hot plate (52\u00a0\u00b0C) immediately after each cycle. Morphine and mitragynine were administered alone, in combination with each other, and in combination with the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Morphine and mitragynine dose-dependently decreased schedule-controlled responding; the ED50 values were 7.3 and 31.5\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. Both drugs increased thermal antinociception; the ED50 value for morphine was 18.3. Further, doses of naltrexone that antagonized morphine did not antagonize mitragynine. Mitragynine (17.8\u00a0mg/kg) did not alter the rate-decreasing or antinociceptive effects of morphine. The antinociceptive effects of mitragynine and morphine occur at doses larger than those that disrupt learned behavior. Opioid receptors do not appear to mediate the disruptive effects of mitragynine on learned behavior.

Administration of high doses of D24M (1 & 10 nmol) into the lateral ventricle did not disrupt home cage wheel running. Repeated twice daily administration of increasing doses of morphine (5-20 mg/kg) over 5 days depressed wheel running and induced antinociceptive tolerance measured with the hot plate test. Administration of D24M had no effect on morphine tolerance, but tended to prolong morphine antinociception in non-tolerant rats. Spontaneous morphine withdrawal was evident as a decrease in body weight, a reduction in wheel running and an increase in sleep during the normally active dark phase of the circadian cycle, and an increase in wheel running and wakefulness in the normally inactive light phase. Administration of D24M during the dark phase on the third day of withdrawal had no effect on wheel running. These data provide additional evidence for the clinical relevance of home cage wheel running as a method to assess spontaneous opioid withdrawal in rats. These data also demonstrate that blocking the MOR/DOR heterodimer does not produce disruptive side effects or block the antinociceptive effects of morphine.

The surgical protocol resulted in a median intravenous jugular catheter patency in male and female rats of 126 days (range: 25-365 days). Drug-vs-food choice was established with opioids (fentanyl and heroin), psychostimulants (cocaine, methamphetamine, and amphetamine), and an opioid/psychostimulant mixture (fentanyl + methamphetamine). The average time from catheter implantation to stable choice behavior across all drugs was 27 sessions (range: 16-44 sessions). Choice behavior stabilized more quickly for cocaine and fentanyl than for other drugs. Manipulations of both environmental variables (e.g., response requirement or food reinforcer magnitude) and pharmacological variables (e.g., extended access drug self-administration or continuous buprenorphine treatment via osmotic pump) significantly shifted opioid-vs-food choice consistent with previous monkey studies.

Buprenorphine HCl and naloxone HCl were co-formulated using an 11:1 ratio of buprenorphine:naloxone in a controlled-release gastric residence formulation administered in an oral capsule (LYN-013). Naloxone was included to determine the feasibility of combining naloxone with buprenorphine in the formulation as an abuse deterrent.

Studying interactions between 5-HT2A receptor agonists and other drugs is important for understanding potential therapeutic effects as well as adverse interactions. Direct-acting 5-HT2A receptor agonists such as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM) and 2-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline (quipazine) enhance some (e.g., antinociceptive) effects of opioids; however, it is unclear whether they alter the abuse-related effects of opioids. This study examined whether DOM and quipazine alter the reinforcing effects of fentanyl in rhesus monkeys (n = 6) responding under a food versus drug choice procedure. Responding on one lever delivered sucrose pellets and responding on the other lever delivered intravenous (i.v.) infusions. In one set of experiments, fentanyl (0.1-3.2 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) versus food choice sessions were preceded by noncontingent i.v. pretreatments with DOM (0032-0.32 mg/kg), quipazine (0.32-1.0 mg/kg), naltrexone (0.032 mg/kg), or heroin (0.1 mg/kg). In another set of experiments, fentanyl was available during choice sessions in combination with DOM (0.32-100 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) or quipazine (3.2-320 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) in varying dose ratios. Naltrexone decreased and heroin increased fentanyl choice, demonstrating sensitivity of responding to pharmacological manipulation. However, whether given as a pretreatment or made available in combination with fentanyl as a mixture, neither DOM nor quipazine significantly altered fentanyl choice. These results suggest that 5-HT2A receptor agonists do not enhance the reinforcing effects of opioids and, thus, will not likely enhance abuse potential.

Participants (n\u2009=\u200958) consisted of pregnant women receiving medications for opioid use disorder and their infants. NOWS severity was operationalized as the need for pharmacologic treatment and prolonged hospitalization (\u2265\u200914\u00a0days). Cord blood miRNAs were assessed using semi-quantitative qRT-PCR arrays. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the curve (AUC) were estimated. The expression of three miRNAs (miR-128-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-421) predicted need for pharmacologic treatment (AUC: 0.85) and prolonged hospitalization (AUC: 0.90). Predictive validity improved after two miRNAs (let-7d-5p, miR-584-5p) were added to the need for pharmacologic treatment model (AUC: 0.94) and another two miRNAs (let-7b-5p, miR-10-5p) to the prolonged hospitalization model (AUC: 0.99). Infant cord blood extracellular miRNAs can proactively identify opioid-exposed neonates at high-risk for developing severe NOWS.", "abstract_id": 35396369, "entities": [{"entity": "Prenatal opioid exposure", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Extracellular microRNAs", "qualifier": ["miR-128-3p", "miR-30c-5p", "miR-421", "let-7d-5p", "miR-584-5p", "let-7b-5p", "miR-10-5p"]}, {"entity": "Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome", "qualifier": ["severity"]}, {"entity": "Extracellular microRNAs", "qualifier": ["miR-128-3p", "miR-30c-5p", "miR-421", "let-7d-5p", "miR-584-5p", "let-7b-5p", "miR-10-5p"]}, {"entity": "Pharmacologic treatment", "qualifier": ["need for"]}, {"entity": "Extracellular microRNAs", "qualifier": ["miR-128-3p", "miR-30c-5p", "miR-421", "let-7d-5p", "miR-584-5p", "let-7b-5p", "miR-10-5p"]}, {"entity": "Hospitalization", "qualifier": ["prolonged"]}]}
{"title": "Neural alterations in opioid-exposed infants revealed by edge-centric brain functional networks.", "abstract": "Prenatal opioid exposure has been linked to adverse effects spanning multiple neurodevelopmental domains, including cognition, motor development, attention, and vision. However, the neural basis of these abnormalities is largely unknown. A total of 49 infants, including 21 opioid-exposed and 28 controls, were enrolled and underwent MRI (43\u2009\u00b1\u20096 days old) after birth, including resting state functional MRI. Edge-centric functional networks based on dynamic functional connections were constructed, and machine-learning methods were employed to identify neural features distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from unexposed controls. An accuracy of 73.6% (sensitivity 76.25% and specificity 69.33%) was achieved using 10 times 10-fold cross-validation, which substantially outperformed those obtained using conventional static functional connections (accuracy 56.9%). More importantly, we identified that prenatal opioid exposure preferentially affects inter- rather than intra-network dynamic functional connections, particularly with the visual, subcortical, and default mode networks. Consistent results at the brain regional and connection levels were also observed, where the brain regions and connections associated with visual and higher order cognitive functions played pivotal roles in distinguishing opioid-exposed infants from controls. Our findings support the clinical phenotype of infants exposed to opioids in utero and may potentially explain the higher rates of visual and emotional problems observed in this population. Finally, our findings suggested that edge-centric networks could better capture the neural differences between opioid-exposed infants and controls by abstracting the intrinsic co-fluctuation along edges, which may provide a promising tool for future studies focusing on investigating the effects of prenatal opioid exposure on neurodevelopment.", "abstract_id": 35602654, "entities": [{"entity": "Infants", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Opioid", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "MRI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Neural features", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Prenatal opioid exposure", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Inter-network dynamic functional connections", "qualifier": ["visual, subcortical, and default mode networks"]}, {"entity": "Brain regions and connections", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Visual and higher order cognitive functions", "qualifier": null}]}

The synergistic effects of comorbid depression and anxiety can lead to maladaptive coping responses to pain, namely pain catastrophizing and illness-related post-traumatic stress disorder. If underlying depression and anxiety and associated maladaptive coping responses are not treated, patients can experience an increased perception of pain, worsened disability, decreased quality of life, withdrawal from social activities, and increased morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, interest in nonpharmacologic treatments for pain that targets coping as well as comorbid anxiety and depression has been increasing, particularly given the significant societal damage that has resulted from the opioid epidemic. Evidence-based, nonpharmacologic treatments have shown promise in treating pain in areas outside of nephrology. Currently, little is known about the effects of these treatments among adults with CKD, and particularly end-stage kidney disease, when chronic pain can become debilitating. In this review, we examine patient-centered concepts related to pain that have received little attention in the nephrology literature.

{"title": "Incidence and predictors of persistent pelvic pain following hysterectomy in women with chronic pelvic pain.", "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain is a debilitating problem that afflicts 15% to 20% of women in the United States. Although more than 200,000 hysterectomies are performed annually for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, previous studies indicate that 1 in 4 women undergo the discomfort and morbidity of hysterectomy without the relief of pain. The factors that predict treatment failure remain poorly characterized. To describe the incidence of persistent pelvic pain 6 months following hysterectomy in women with chronic pelvic pain and determine whether a simple, self-reported measure of central sensitization is associated with a greater risk of persistent pelvic pain following hysterectomy. We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of women undergoing hysterectomy at an academic tertiary care center for a benign indication. Patients with preoperative chronic pelvic pain, defined as average pelvic pain \u22653 on a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale for >3 months before hysterectomy, were included in this analysis. The patients completed validated assessments of pain, anxiety, depression, and centralized pain (using the 2011 Fibromyalgia Survey Criteria, 0-31 points) preoperatively and 6 months after hysterectomy. The demographic information, surgical history, intraoperative findings, and surgical pathology were abstracted from the electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of persistent pelvic pain 6 months following hysterectomy, defined as <50% improvement in pelvic pain severity. Among 176 participants with pelvic pain before hysterectomy, 126 (71.6%) were retained at 6 months, and 15 (11.9%) reported persistent pelvic pain. There was no difference in age (P=.46), race (P=.55), average pain severity during menses (P=.68), average overall pelvic pain (P=.10), or pain duration (P=.80) in those with and without persistent pelvic pain. Whereas intraoperative findings of endometriosis (P=.05) and uterine fibroids (P=.03) were associated with a higher incidence of persistent pain on univariate analysis, the surgical route (P=.46), pelvic adhesions (0.51), uterine weight (P=.66), and adenomyosis on histopathology (P=.27) were not related to the risk of persistent pain. Higher preoperative centralized pain scores (P=.01) but not depression (P=.64) or anxiety (P=.45) were more common in women with persistent pelvic pain. Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, preoperative pain severity, anxiety, depression, and operative findings of endometriosis and fibroids indicated that every 1-point increase in centralized pain before hysterectomy was associated with a 27% increase in the odds of persistent pelvic pain (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.57) 6 months after surgery.

We present an approach to characterizing the epidemiology, policy and resource environment for OUD and its consequences, with a focus on eleven rural counties in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont between 2014 and 2018. We developed health policy summaries and logic models to facilitate comparison of opioid epidemic-related polices across the three states that could influence the risk environment and access to services. We assessed sociodemographic factors, rates of overdose and infectious complications tied to OUD, and drive-time access to prevention and treatment resources. We developed GIS maps and conducted spatial analyses to assess the opioid crisis landscape. Through collaborative research, we assessed the potential impact of available resources to address the opioid crisis in rural New England. Vermont's comprehensive set of policies and practices for drug treatment and harm reduction appeared to be associated with the lowest fatal overdose rates. Franklin County, Massachusetts had good access to naloxone, drug treatment and SSPs, but relatively high overdose and HIV rates. New Hampshire had high proportions of uninsured community members, the highest overdose rates, no HCV surveillance data, and no local access to SSPs.

The study aimed to understand barriers to medication access from the perspective of legally involved veterans with opioid use disorder and people who work with these veterans in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the legal system. This national qualitative study interviewed veterans and stakeholders from 14 geographically diverse VHA facilities to explore perceptions of barriers to medications for opioid use disorder.

We conducted interviews based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a team-based approach. Four key barriers, noted by group, were identified: (1) a preference for counseling along with or instead of medications (veterans, Specialists, treatment providers, criminal justice staff); (2) concerns about veterans using medications without a prescription, selling them, or providing them to others (veterans, Specialists, treatment providers, criminal justice staff); (3) concerns about perceived stigma towards medication use (veterans, Specialists, treatment providers, criminal justice staff); and (4) concerns about medication discontinuation after recurrent opioid use (veterans, criminal justice staff). A fifth theme, education, was noted by all stakeholders except providers as important to facilitating use of medications for opioid use disorder.

To compare opioid overdose death (OOD) rates among formerly incarcerated persons (FIPs) from 2016 to 2018 with the North Carolina population and with OOD rates from 2000 to 2015. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of 259\u2009861 North Carolina FIPs from 2000 to 2018 linked with North Carolina death records. We used indirectly standardized OOD mortality rates and ratios and present 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results. From 2017 to 2018, the OOD rates in the North Carolina general population decreased by 10.1% but increased by 32% among FIPs. During 2016 to 2018, the highest substance-specific OOD rate among FIPs was attributable to synthetic narcotics (mainly fentanyl and its analogs), while OOD rates for other opioids were half or less than that from synthetic narcotics. During 2016 to 2018, the OOD risk for FIPs from synthetic narcotics was 50.3 (95% CI\u2009=\u200930.9, 69.6), 20.2 (95% CI\u2009=\u200917.3, 23.2), and 18.2 (95% CI\u2009=\u200915.9, 20.5) times as high as that for the North Carolina population at 2-week, 1-year, and complete follow-up after release, respectively.

When considering these behaviors together, analyses indicated that the effect of problem substance use (\u00df\u2009=\u20090.648, p\u2009=\u20090.154) on testing is explained by sexual risk behavior (\u00df\u2009=\u20091.425, p\u2009<\u20090.01). The study's findings underscore the value of using routine automated risk screenings to collect sensitive data from emergency department patients, followed by computer-based HIV test offers for adolescent youth.

Previous work found substantial risk of co-morbid alcohol and opioid misuse in a community sample of opioid-prescribed individuals with chronic pain, a finding expanded upon here. Specifically, 211 veterans assessed within a chronic pain treatment service for opioid-prescribed individuals completed self-report measures of opioid misuse, alcohol misuse, pain intensity, depression, pain catastrophizing, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTS). Based on the substance misuse measures, 32% (n\u00a0=\u00a068) were misusing neither opioids nor alcohol, 23% (n\u00a0=\u00a048) were misusing both opioids and alcohol, 40% (n\u00a0=\u00a084) were misusing opioids alone, and 5% (n\u00a0=\u00a011) were misusing alcohol alone. Group comparisons indicated that individuals not misusing either substance were less distressed in comparison to those who were misusing opioids alone or both substances. The latter groups differed in PTS. Overall, misuse frequencies mirrored previous work, with approximately 1 of 3 misusing opioids and approximately 1 of 5 misusing both substances. There is a need for increased focus on both polysubstance misuse and the development of integrated treatment. PERSPECTIVE: Opioid and alcohol misuse was examined in 211 Veterans prescribed opioids for chronic pain.

Using subjects' times of death as a marker of time of day, we investigated transcriptional rhythms in the brains of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected comparison subjects. We discovered rhythmic transcripts in both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), key brain areas involved in OUD, that were largely distinct between OUD and unaffected subjects. Fewer rhythmic transcripts were identified in DLPFC of subjects with OUD compared to unaffected subjects, whereas in the NAc, nearly double the number of rhythmic transcripts was identified in subjects with OUD. In NAc of subjects with OUD, rhythmic transcripts peaked either in the evening or near sunrise, and were associated with an opioid, dopamine, and GABAergic neurotransmission. Associations with altered neurotransmission in NAc were further supported by co-expression network analysis which identified OUD-specific modules enriched for transcripts involved in dopamine, GABA, and glutamatergic synaptic functions. Additionally, rhythmic transcripts in DLPFC and NAc of subjects with OUD were enriched for genomic loci associated with sleep-related GWAS traits, including sleep duration and insomnia.

{"title": "Sex-specific role of the circadian transcription factor NPAS2 in opioid tolerance, withdrawal and analgesia.", "abstract": "Opioids like fentanyl remain the mainstay treatment for chronic pain. Unfortunately, opioid's high dependence liability has led to the current opioid crisis, in part, because of side-effects that develop during long-term use, including analgesic tolerance and physical dependence.

Additionally, altered sleep and circadian rhythms are common in people on opioid therapy. Opioids impact sleep and circadian rhythms, while disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms likely mediate the effects of opioids. However, the mechanisms underlying these bidirectional relationships between circadian rhythms and opioids remain largely unknown. The circadian protein, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), regulates circadian-dependent gene transcription in structure of the central nervous system that modulate opioids and pain. Here, male and female wild-type and NPAS2-deficient (NPAS2-/-) mice were used to investigate the role of NPAS2 in fentanyl analgesia, tolerance, hyperalgesia and physical dependence. Overall, thermal pain thresholds, acute analgesia and tolerance to a fixed dose of fentanyl were largely similar between wild-type and NPAS2-/- mice. However, female NPAS2-/- exhibited augmented analgesic tolerance and significantly more behavioral symptoms of physical dependence to fentanyl. Only male NPAS2-/- mice had increased fentanyl-induced hypersensitivity, when compared with wild-type males. Together, our findings suggest sex-specific effects of NPAS2 signaling in the regulation of fentanyl-induced tolerance, hyperalgesia and dependence.", "abstract_id": 36053258, "entities": [{"entity": "Fentanyl", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Chronic pain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NPAS2", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fentanyl analgesia", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "NPAS2", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fentanyl-induced hypersensitivity", "qualifier": null}]}

Patients with SCD may suffer from both acute and chronic pain. Acute pain is caused by recurrent and unpredictable episodes of vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), whereas the exact etiology of chronic pain is still unknown. Opioids are the mainstay for pain treatment, but the opioid epidemic has significantly altered access to prescription opioids and has brought concerns over their long-term use into the forefront, which have negatively impacted the treatment of sickle pain. Opioids remain potent analgesics but growing opioid-phobia has led to the realization of an unmet need to develop nonopioid therapies that can provide relief for severe sickle pain. This realization has contributed to the approval of 3 different drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD, particularly to reduce VOC and/or have an impact on the pathobiology of SCD.

Bias was assessed via testing for differences in type II error rates across racial/ethnic subgroups (Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White, Other) using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. A local surrogate model was estimated to interpret the classifier's predictions by race and averaged globally from the datasets. Subgroup analyses and post-hoc recalibrations were conducted to attempt to mitigate biased metrics. We identified bias in the false negative rate (FNR = 0.32) of the Black subgroup compared to the FNR (0.17) of the White subgroup. Top features included \"heroin\" and \"substance abuse\" across subgroups. Post-hoc recalibrations eliminated bias in FNR with minimal changes in other subgroup error metrics. The Black FNR subgroup had higher risk scores for readmission and mortality than the White FNR subgroup, and a higher mortality risk score than the Black true positive subgroup (P\u2009<\u2009.05). The Black FNR subgroup had the greatest severity of disease and risk for poor outcomes. Similar features were present between subgroups for predicting opioid misuse, but inequities were present.

However, abstinence from all non-prescribed substance use continues to be prioritized as the only desired goal in many outpatient, primary care-based treatment programs. This presents a barrier to engagement for patients who continue to use substances and who may be at high risk for complications of ongoing substance use such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), superficial and deep tissue infections, and overdose. Harm reduction aims to reduce the negative consequences of substance use and offers an alternative to abstinence as a singular goal. Incorporating harm reduction principles into primary care treatment settings can support programs in engaging patients with ongoing substance use and facilitate the delivery of evidence-based screening and prevention services. The objective of this narrative review is to describe strategies for the integration of evidence-based harm reduction principles and interventions into outpatient, primary care-based OUD treatment settings. We will offer specific tools for providers and programs including strategies to support safer injection practices, assess the risks and benefits of continuing medications for opioid use disorder in the setting of ongoing substance use, promote a non-stigmatizing program culture, and address the needs of special populations with ongoing substance use including adolescents, parents, and families.", "abstract_id": 34159545, "entities": [{"entity": "Opioid use disorder (OUD)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "primary care settings", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Patients", "qualifier": ["who continue to use substances"]}, {"entity": "abstinence", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Harm reduction", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "negative consequences of substance use", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Harm reduction principles", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "primary care treatment settings", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Providers and programs", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "safer injection practices", "qualifier": null}]}

Rates of opioid dispensing to opioid-na\u00efve individuals decreased significantly during the EO, but increased nearly to pre-SOE levels after health care services began reopening. Dispensing rates in low broadband counties were higher than those in high broadband counties during all time periods, although these differences were negligible after adjusting for potential confounders.

We examined the rates of serious adverse events and common side effects to establish safety and tolerability, respectively, in HD-tDCS. Blinding was evaluated using participants' accuracy in correctly stating their condition (i.e., active or sham). The sample included 101 older adults (Mage\u202f=\u202f69.69, SD\u202f=\u202f8.33; Meduc\u202f=\u202f16.27, SD\u202f=\u202f2.42) who participated in our double blind randomized controlled studies or in case studies that used HD-tDCS for 20-30\u202fmin at 2\u202fmA (n\u202f=\u202f66, 31 active) or 3\u202fmA (n\u202f=\u202f35, 20 active). Participants completed a standardized side effect questionnaire and were asked whether they received active or sham stimulation at the end of each session.

{"title": "Spinal Inhibition of P2XR or p38 Signaling Disrupts Hyperalgesic Priming in Male, but not Female, Mice.", "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphisms in the mechanisms contributing to the development of chronic pain. Here we tested the hypothesis that microglia might preferentially regulate hyperalgesic priming in male mice. We based this hypothesis on evidence that microglia preferentially contribute to neuropathic pain in male mice via ionotropic purinergic receptor (P2XR) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) signaling. Mice given a single-priming injection of the soluble human interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6r) and then a second injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which unmasks hyperalgesic priming, shows a significant increase in levels of activated microglia at 3\u202fh following the PGE2 injection in both male and female mice. There was no change in microglia following PGE2. Intrathecal injection of the P2X3/4 inhibitor TNP-ATP blocked the initial response to IL-6r in both males and females, but only blocked hyperalgesic priming in male mice. Intrathecally applied p38 inhibitor, skepinone, had no effect on the initial response to IL-6r but attenuated hyperalgesic priming in males only. Neither TNP-ATP nor skepinone could reverse priming once it had already been established in male mice suggesting that these pathways must be inhibited early in the development of hyperalgesic priming to have an effect. Our work is consistent with previous findings that P2XR and p38 inhibition can lead to male-specific effects on pain behaviors in mice. However, given that we did not observe microglial activation at time points where these drugs were effective, our work also questions whether these effects can be completely attributed to microglia.", "abstract_id": 29913243, "entities": [{"entity": "P2XR or p38 signaling", "qualifier": ["in the spine"]}, {"entity": "Hyperalgesic priming", "qualifier": ["in male mice"]}, {"entity": "TNP-ATP", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Initial response to IL-6r", "qualifier": ["in both males and females"]}, {"entity": "Skepinone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Hyperalgesic priming", "qualifier": ["in males only"]}, {"entity": "TNP-ATP or Skepinone", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Priming", "qualifier": ["once it had already been established in male mice"]}]}

Peak and trough concentrations of enantiomers, total methadone, and AAG levels were correlated with clinical outcomes including pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), respiratory depression, and QT interval prolongation. The study population included 38 children (10.8-17.9 years): 25 PSF and 13 PE patients. Median total methadone peak plasma concentration was 24.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 19.2-40.8) ng/mL and the median trough was 4.09 (IQR, 2.74-6.4) ng/mL. AAG concentration almost doubled at 48 hours after surgery (median = 193.9, IQR = 86.3-279.5 \u00b5g/mL) from intraoperative levels (median = 87.4, IQR = 70.6-115.8 \u00b5g/mL; P < .001), and change of AAG from intraoperative period to 48 hours postoperatively correlated with R-EDDP (P < .001) levels, S-EDDP (P < .001) levels, and pain scores (P = .008). Median opioid usage was minimal, 0.66 (IQR, 0.59-0.75) mg/kg morphine equivalents/d. No respiratory depression (95% Wilson binomial confidence, 0-0.09) or clinically significant QT prolongation (median = 9, IQR = -10 to 28 milliseconds) occurred. PONV occurred in 12 patients and was correlated with morphine equivalent dose (P = .005). Novel multiple small perioperative methadone doses resulted in safe and lower blood methadone levels, <100 ng/mL, a threshold previously associated with respiratory depression. This methadone dosing in a multimodal regimen resulted in lower blood methadone analgesia concentrations than the historically described minimum analgesic concentrations of methadone from an era before multimodal postoperative analgesia without postoperative respiratory depression and prolonged corrected QT (QTc).

{"title": "Anti-inflammatory dopamine- and serotonin-based endocannabinoid epoxides reciprocally regulate cannabinoid receptors and the TRPV1 channel.", "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system is a promising target to mitigate pain as the endocannabinoids are endogenous ligands of the pain-mediating receptors-cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) and TRPV1. Herein, we report on a class of lipids formed by the epoxidation of N-arachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA) and N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (NA5HT) by epoxygenases. EpoNADA and epoNA5HT are dual-functional rheostat modulators of the endocannabinoid-TRPV1 axis. EpoNADA and epoNA5HT are stronger modulators of TRPV1 than either NADA or NA5HT, and epoNA5HT displays a significantly stronger inhibition on TRPV1-mediated responses in primary afferent neurons. Moreover, epoNA5HT is a full CB1 agonist. These epoxides reduce the pro-inflammatory biomarkers IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and nitrous oxide and raise anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine in activated microglial cells. The epoxides are spontaneously generated by activated microglia cells and their formation is potentiated in the presence of anandamide. Detailed kinetics and molecular dynamics simulation studies provide evidence for this potentiation using the epoxygenase human CYP2J2. Taken together, inflammation leads to an increase in the metabolism of NADA, NA5HT and other eCBs by epoxygenases to form the corresponding epoxides. The epoxide metabolites are bioactive lipids that are potent, multi-faceted molecules, capable of influencing the activity of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors.", "abstract_id": 33568652, "entities": [{"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "TRPV1", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "EpoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "CB1", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pro-inflammatory biomarkers", "qualifier": ["IL-6", "IL-1\u03b2", "TNF-\u03b1", "Nitrous oxide"]}, {"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "IL-10", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Inflammation", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "EpoNADA and epoNA5HT", "qualifier": null}]}

SIM is especially important to examine given frequent undercounting of suicides amongst drug overdose deaths. We report suicide and SIM trends in the United States of America (US) during 1999-2018, portray interstate rate trends, and examine spatiotemporal (spacetime) diffusion or spread of the drug self-intoxication component of SIM, with attention to potential for differential suicide misclassification. For this state-based, cross-sectional, panel time series, we used de-identified manner and underlying cause-of-death data for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC) from CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Procedures comprised joinpoint regression to describe national trends; Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient to assess interstate SIM and suicide rate congruence; and spacetime hierarchical modelling of the 'nonsuicide' SIM component. The national annual average percentage change over the observation period in the SIM rate was 4.3% (95% CI: 3.3%, 5.4%; p<0.001) versus 1.8% (95% CI: 1.6%, 2.0%; p<0.001) for the suicide rate. By 2017/2018, all states except Nebraska (19.9) posted a SIM rate of at least 21.0 deaths per 100,000 population-the floor of the rate range for the top 5 ranking states in 1999/2000. The rank-order correlation coefficient for SIM and suicide rates was 0.82 (p<0.001) in 1999/2000 versus 0.34 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) by 2017/2018. Seven states in the West posted a\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.0% reduction in their standardised mortality ratios of 'nonsuicide' drug fatalities, relative to the national ratio, and 6 states from the other 3 major regions a >6.0% increase (p<0.05). Depiction of rising SIM trends across states and major regions unmasks a burgeoning national mental health crisis. Geographic variation is plausibly a partial product of local heterogeneity in toxic drug availability and the quality of medicolegal death investigations. Like COVID-19, the nation will only be able to prevent SIM by responding with collective, comprehensive, systemic approaches.

In-depth semi-structured interviews (n\u00a0=\u00a023) were conducted with programs for women and children affected by OUD across North America. Using a phenomenologic approach, key program components and themes were identified. Following thematic saturation, these results were triangulated with experts in program implementation and with a subset of key informants to ensure data integrity. Five distinct types of programs were identified that varied in the degree of medical and behavioral care for families. Three themes emerged unique to the provision of dyadic care: 1) families require supportive, frequent visits with a range of providers, but constraints around billable services limit care integration across the perinatal continuum; 2) individual program champions are critical, but degree and reach of interdisciplinary care is limited by siloed systems for medical and behavioral care; and 3) addressing dual, sometimes competing, responsibilities for both parental and infant health following recurrence of parental substance use presents unique challenges.

Short forms were derived from the University of Washington concerns about pain (UWCAP) and pain-related self-efficacy (UWPRSE) item banks. Participants with low back pain (LBP) in a clinical trial (n\u2009=\u2009241) examining nonpharmacologic treatments completed the 8-item UWCAP and 9-item UWPRSE and a numeric pain intensity rating, Oswestry Disability and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaires at baseline, 1-, 4- and 12-weeks after enrollment. Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients estimated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. Floor and ceiling effects for the UWCAP and UWPRSE were examined. Concurrent validity was evaluated with univariate correlation coefficients and predictive validity with multivariate regression models. Participants were divided into categories of treatment responsiveness based on a single-item global rating measure, and UWPRSE and UWCAP change scores and standardized effect sizes were calculated in each category. Both short forms had good internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.89-0.90) and test-retest reliability (ICC\u2009=\u20090.77-0.85), without substantial floor or ceiling effects. As expected, the UWCAP was positively correlated, and UWPRSE negatively correlated, with concurrent measures of pain intensity, disability and fear-avoidance beliefs. The UWCAP added to the prediction model for 4-week disability outcomes (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.25, p\u2009=\u20090.008).

{"title": "Brain Mechanisms of Virtual Reality Breathing Versus Traditional Mindful Breathing in Pain Modulation: Observational Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy Study.", "abstract": "Pain is a complex experience that involves sensory-discriminative and cognitive-emotional neuronal processes. It has long been known across cultures that pain can be relieved by mindful breathing (MB). There is a common assumption that MB exerts its analgesic effect through interoception. Interoception refers to consciously refocusing the mind's attention to the physical sensation of internal organ function. In this study, we dissect the cortical analgesic processes by imaging the brains of healthy subjects exposed to traditional MB (TMB) and compare them with another group for which we augmented MB to an outside sensory experience via virtual reality breathing (VRB). The VRB protocol involved in-house-developed virtual reality 3D lungs that synchronized with the participants' breathing cycles in real time, providing them with an immersive visual-auditory exteroception of their breathing. We found that both breathing interventions led to a significant increase in pain thresholds after week-long practices, as measured by a thermal quantitative sensory test. However, the underlying analgesic brain mechanisms were opposite, as revealed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy data. In the TMB practice, the anterior prefrontal cortex uniquely modulated the premotor cortex. This increased its functional connection with the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), thereby facilitating the S1-based sensory-interoceptive processing of breathing but inhibiting its other role in sensory-discriminative pain processing. In contrast, virtual reality induced an immersive 3D exteroception with augmented visual-auditory cortical activations, which diminished the functional connection with the S1 and consequently weakened the pain processing function of the S1. In summary, our study suggested two analgesic neuromechanisms of VRB and TMB practices-exteroception and interoception-that distinctively modulated the S1 processing of the ascending noxious inputs. This is in line with the concept of dualism (Yin and Yang).", "abstract_id": 34636731, "entities": [{"entity": "Mindful Breathing (MB)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Pain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Anterior Prefrontal Cortex", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Virtual Reality Breathing (VRB)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1)", "qualifier": null}]}

Patients with OUD require services from community-based organizations, local and state health departments, and health systems, all of which necessitate communication and collaboration among these groups to develop an effective strategy for diagnosis, treatment, and coordination of care. Academic health centers (AHCs) are poised to make significant contributions to the care of patients with OUD given in-house expertise across multiple medical specialties and the mission to care for patients in need. Despite the potential for AHCs to provide necessary services and address this public health crisis, progress has been slow. Many AHCs lack a clear roadmap for moving this agenda forward in their local regions. In response to rising deaths due to OUD, the authors' AHC undertook a significant redesign effort to facilitate the necessary processes and interdepartmental collaboration to provide patient-centered, comprehensive care for patients with OUD. In this article, using an organizational development framework (McKinsey 7S model), the authors describe their transformation process, and articulate strategies and potential barriers to implementing this framework.

Here, we tested whether amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) mediated the relationship between catastrophizing (negative threat appraisals and predicting poorer functioning) and altered threat-safety discrimination learning (critical to flexibly adapt to new and changing environments) in adolescents with persistent pain. We examined amygdala rsFC in 46 youth with chronic pain and 29 healthy peers (age M = 15.8, SD = 2.9; 64 females) and its relationship with catastrophizing and threat-safety learning. We used a developmentally appropriate threat-safety learning paradigm and performed amygdala seed-based rsFC and whole-brain mediation analyses. Patients exhibited enhanced connectivity between the left amygdala and right supramarginal gyrus (SMG) (cluster-level P-FDR < 0.05), whereas right amygdala rsFC showed no group differences. Only in patients, elevated catastrophizing was associated with facilitated threat-safety learning (CS+>CS-; rp = 0.49, P = 0.001). Furthermore, in patients, elevated catastrophizing was associated with reduced left amygdala connectivity with SMG / parietal operculum, and increased left amygdala connectivity with hippocampus, dorsal striatum, paracingulate, and motor regions (P < 0.001). In addition, blunted left amygdala rsFC with right SMG/parietal operculum mediated the association between catastrophizing and threat-safety learning (P < 0.001). To conclude, rsFC between the left amygdala (a core emotion hub) and inferior parietal lobe (involved in appraisal and integration of bodily signals and attentional reorienting) explains associations between daily-life relevant catastrophizing and threat-safety learning.

However, until recently, relatively few studies had specifically examined the relationships between early life stress (ELS) and opioid use disorder (OUD). Associations with opioid use initiation, injection drug use, overdose, and poor treatment outcome have now been demonstrated. In rodents, ELS has also been shown to increase the euphoric and decrease antinociceptive effects of opioids, but little is known about these processes in humans or about the neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie these relationships. This review aims to establish a theoretical model that highlights the mechanisms by which ELS may alter opioid sensitivity, thereby contributing to future risks for OUD. Alterations induced by ELS in mesocorticolimbic brain circuits, and endogenous opioid and dopamine neurotransmitter systems are described. The limited but provocative evidence linking these alterations with opioid sensitivity and risks for OUD is presented.

In this study, effects of diet and obesity were examined in the paw incision model, a preclinical model of postoperative pain. Long-Evans rats were fed high-fat diet (40% calories from butter fat) or low-fat normal chow. Male rats fed high-fat diet starting 6 weeks before incision (a diet previously shown to induce markers of obesity) had prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity and an overall increase in spontaneous pain in response to paw incision, compared with normal chow controls. Diet effects in females were minor. Removing high-fat diet for 2 weeks before incision reversed the diet effects on pain behaviors, although this was not enough time to reverse high-fat diet-induced weight gain. A shorter (1 week) exposure to high-fat diet before incision also increased pain behaviors in males, albeit to a lesser degree. The 6-week high-fat diet increased macrophage density as examined immunohistochemically in lumbar dorsal root ganglion even before paw incision, especially in males, and sensitized responses of peritoneal macrophages to lipopolysaccharide stimuli in vitro. The nerve regeneration marker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) in skin near the incision (day 4) was higher in the high-fat diet group, and wound healing was delayed.

We found that Y1R-expressing spinal neurons contain multiple markers of excitatory but not inhibitory interneurons in the rat superficial dorsal horn. To test the relevance of this spinal population to the development and/or maintenance of acute and neuropathic pain, we selectively ablated Y1R-expressing interneurons with intrathecal administration of an NPY-conjugated saporin ribosomal neurotoxin that spares the central terminals of primary afferents. NPY-saporin decreased spinal Y1R immunoreactivity but did not change the primary afferent terminal markers isolectin B4 or calcitonin-gene-related peptide immunoreactivity. In the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, NPY-saporin decreased mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, but disrupted neither normal mechanical or thermal thresholds, motor coordination, nor locomotor activity. We conclude that Y1R-expressing excitatory dorsal horn interneurons facilitate neuropathic pain hypersensitivity.

People with OUD often experience comorbid medical conditions. Systematical approaches to identifying co-occurring conditions of OUD can facilitate a deeper understanding of OUD mechanisms and drug discovery. This study presents an integrated approach combining data mining, network construction and ranking, and hypothesis-driven case-control studies using patient electronic health records (EHRs). First, we mined comorbidities from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) of 12 million unique case reports using frequent pattern-growth algorithm. The performance of OUD comorbidity mining was measured by precision and recall using manually curated known OUD comorbidities. We then constructed a disease comorbidity network using mined association rules and further prioritized OUD comorbidities. Last, novel OUD comorbidities were independently tested using EHRs of 75 million unique patients. The OUD comorbidities from association rules mining achieves a precision of 38.7% and a recall of 78.2 Based on the mined rules, the global DCN was constructed with 1916 nodes and 32,175 edges. The network-based OUD ranking result shows that 43 of 55 known OUD comorbidities were in the first decile with a precision of 78.2%. Hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes were two top-ranked novel OUD comorbidities identified by data mining and network ranking algorithms. Based on EHR-based case-control studies, we showed that patients with OUD had significantly increased risk for hyperthyroidism (AOR\u2009=\u20091.46, 95% CI 1.43-1.49, p value\u2009<\u20090.001), hypothyroidism (AOR\u2009=\u20091.45, 95% CI 1.42-1.48, p value\u2009<\u20090.001), type 2-diabetes (AOR\u2009=\u20091.28, 95% CI 1.26-1.29, p value\u2009<\u20090.001), compared with individuals without OUD.

Among the 124 reporting injection drug use, 50% indicated they injected both methamphetamine and heroin in the past 30 days. Interview participants reported early exposure to methamphetamine and indicated that methamphetamine was more widely available, less expensive, and less stigmatized compared to heroin. Participants reported using methamphetamine to improve work-life functioning and because they enjoy the high produced from simultaneous use. Several participants reported a conscious effort to shift to methamphetamine from heroin as a harm reduction strategy.Some participants reported being involuntarily discharged from treatment for opioid use disorder due to methamphetamine use.

{"title": "Addressing identification bias in the design and analysis of cluster-randomized pragmatic trials: a case study.", "abstract": "Pragmatic trials provide the opportunity to study the effectiveness of health interventions to improve care in real-world settings. However, use of open-cohort designs with patients becoming eligible after randomization and reliance on electronic health records (EHRs) to identify participants may lead to a form of selection bias referred to as identification bias. This bias can occur when individuals identified as a result of the treatment group assignment are included in analyses. To demonstrate the importance of identification bias and how it can be addressed, we consider a motivating case study, the PRimary care Opioid Use Disorders treatment (PROUD) Trial. PROUD is an ongoing pragmatic, cluster-randomized implementation trial in six health systems to evaluate a program for increasing medication treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs). A main study objective is to evaluate whether the PROUD intervention decreases acute care utilization among patients with OUD (effectiveness aim). Identification bias is a particular concern, because OUD is underdiagnosed in the EHR at baseline, and because the intervention is expected to increase OUD diagnosis among current patients and attract new patients with OUD to the intervention site. We propose a framework for addressing this source of bias in the statistical design and analysis. The statistical design sought to balance the competing goals of fully capturing intervention effects and mitigating identification bias, while maximizing power. For the primary analysis of the effectiveness aim, identification bias was avoided by defining the study sample using pre-randomization data (pre-trial modeling demonstrated that the optimal approach was to use individuals with a prior OUD diagnosis). To expand generalizability of study findings, secondary analyses were planned that also included patients newly diagnosed post-randomization, with analytic methods to account for identification bias. As more studies seek to leverage existing data sources, such as EHRs, to make clinical trials more affordable and generalizable and to apply novel open-cohort study designs, the potential for identification bias is likely to become increasingly common. This case study highlights how this bias can be addressed in the statistical study design and analysis. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03407638.

{"title": "Kratom policy: The challenge of balancing therapeutic potential with public safety.", "abstract": "Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tree-like plant indigenous to Southeast Asia. Its leaves, and the teas brewed from them have long been used by people in that region to stave off fatigue and to manage pain and opioid withdrawal. Evidence suggests kratom is being increasingly used by people in the United States and Europe for the self-management of opioid withdrawal and treatment of pain. Recent studies have confirmed that kratom and its chemical constituents have potentially useful pharmacological actions. However, there have also been increasing numbers of reports of adverse effects resulting from use of kratom products. In August 2016, the US Drug Enforcement Administration announced plans to classify kratom and its mitragynine constituents as Schedule I Controlled Substances, a move that triggered a massive response from pro-kratom advocates. The debate regarding the risks, and benefits and safety of kratom continues to intensify. Kratom proponents tout kratom as a safer and less addictive alternative to opioids for the management of pain and opioid addiction. The anti-kratom faction argues that kratom, itself, is a dangerous and addictive drug that ought to be banned. Given the widespread use of kratom and the extensive media attention it is receiving, it is important for physicians, scientists and policy makers to be knowledgeable about the subject. The purpose of this commentary is to update readers about recent developments and controversies in this rapidly evolving area. All of the authors are engaged in various aspects of kratom research and it is our intention to provide a fair and balanced overview that can form the basis for informed decisions on kratom policy. Our conclusions from these analyses are: (a) User reports and results of preclinical studies in animals strongly suggest that kratom and its main constituent alkaloid, mitragynine may have useful activity in alleviating pain and managing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, even though well-controlled clinical trials have yet to be done. (b) Even though kratom lacks many of the toxicities of classic opioids, there are legitimate concerns about the safety and lack of quality control of purported \"kratom\" products that are being sold in the US.

This study aims to determine if altered trunk control associated with recurrent low back pain persists beyond symptom duration. Twenty young adults with recurrent LBP were tested once during an LBP episode and once in symptom remission, and twenty matched back-healthy participants served as controls. Participants walked on a treadmill with five prescribed step widths (0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.33, 1.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0preferred step width). Motion capture and surface electromyography were used to record trunk kinematics and muscle activation. Thorax-pelvis coordination was calculated using vector coding, and longissimus activation and co-activation were analyzed. Young adults with recurrent LBP exhibited a \"looser\" trunk control strategy in the frontal plane during gait that was persistent regardless of pain status across multiple step widths compared to controls. The looser trunk control was demonstrated by a greater pelvis-only, less thorax-only coordination pattern, and decreased bilateral longissimus co-activation in individuals with recurrent LBP compared to controls. The looser trunk control strategy was further amplified when individuals were in symptom remission and exhibited greater trunk excursion and reduced in-phase coordination in the frontal plane. The amplification of aberrant movement during symptom remission may suggest that movement patterns or anatomical factors existing prior to the tested painful episode underlie altered trunk control in individuals with recurrent LBP.

We performed a cross-sectional study of the laboratory values with 3 cycles (2011-2016) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in March 2020. NHANES sampling is conducted using a multistaged, stratified, cluster sampling technique to create a representative sample of the United States. We excluded patients with histories of cancer and under the age of 25 years. Our final sample size was 11,061 (n = 162,547,635), with 797 reportedly using a prescription opioid in the past 30 days-a weighted percent representing 22.95% of the US population. Our analyses identified mean differences in biomarkers between individuals taking prescription opioids and the US population. Laboratory values from the comprehensive metabolic panel were all within reference ranges for both groups, with only bilirubin levels being statistically lower in the group currently taking prescription opioids. Values from the lipid panel of both the opioid using and comparison groups were above reference range for total cholesterol and fasting glucose. The opioid using group was also higher than the reference range for triglycerides (mean [M] = 165.4, standard deviation [SD] = 14.2) and insulin (M = 15.5, SD = 2.2), whereas the comparison group was not.\u00a0 The oral glucose measure was within normal ranges for both groups; however, the opioid using group was 13.7 points higher than the comparison group (M = 122.3, SD = 1.8; M = 108.6, SD = 4.0; P < 0.01). While our study uses a large sample for a robust generalizable analysis it is a correlation study and a longitudinal cohort would provide better evidence linking potential disease states to prescription opioid use. Although all Americans should be alarmed at the lipid levels reported in this study, specific combinations of heightened lipid laboratory values among prescription opioid users accelerate the trajectories toward comorbidities-heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes-leading to diminished quality of life.

This longitudinal cohort study of cancer patients investigated the relationships between changes in psychosocial factors and changes in pain severity and interference over time. Data from patients with cancer and chronic pain (n\u00a0=\u00a0316) treated at a tertiary pain clinic were prospectively collected. At their baseline visit (Time 1), patients provided demographic and clinical information, and completed validated psychosocial and pain assessments. Psychosocial and pain assessments were repeated at a follow-up visit (Time 2), on average 4.9\u00a0months later. Change scores (Time 2-Time 1) were computed for psychosocial and pain variables. Multivariable hierarchical linear regressions assessed the associations between changes in psychosocial factors with changes in pain outcomes over time.

Adult cancer survivors were randomly assigned to listen to hypnosis (n\u2009=\u200955) or relaxation recordings (n\u2009=\u200954) daily for 28\u00a0days. Primary (pain intensity) and secondary outcomes (pain interference, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance) measures were completed pre- and post-treatment.

Both hypnosis and relaxation provided significant and moderate to large improvements in the primary outcome and the secondary outcomes of pain interference and anxiety (ds\u2009=\u20090.44-0.88). The hypnosis group also experienced a moderate improvement in fatigue (d\u2009=\u20090.47) and sleep disturbance (d\u2009=\u20090.54).

We assessed the average cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental cost effectiveness ratios of varied RCT designs and the impact on cost-effectiveness by the inclusion of a RI period vs. No-Run-In (NRI) period. We demonstrated the potential impact of varying the number of institutions, number of patients that could be accommodated per institution, cost and effectiveness discounts, RCT component costs, and patient adherence characteristics on varied RI and NRI RCT designs. In the specific CP RCT designs that we analyzed, we demonstrated that lower patient adherence, lower baseline assessment costs, and higher treatment costs all necessitated the inclusion of an RI period to be cost-effective compared to NRI RCT designs.

Yet physicians will continue to prescribe oral opioids for moderate-to-severe pain in the absence of alternative therapeutics, underscoring the importance in understanding how drug choice can influence detrimental outcomes. One of the opioid prescription medications that led to this crisis is oxycodone, where misuse of this drug has been rampant. Being one of the most highly prescribed opioid medications for treating moderate-to-severe pain as reflected in the skyrocketed increase in retail sales of 866% between 1997 and 2007, oxycodone was initially suggested to be less addictive than morphine. The false-claimed non-addictive formulation of oxycodone, OxyContin, further contributed to the opioid crisis. Abuse was often carried out by crushing the pills for immediate burst release, typically by nasal insufflation, or by liquefying the pills for intravenous injection. Here, we review oxycodone pharmacology and abuse liability as well as present the hypothesis that oxycodone may exhibit a unique pharmacology that contributes to its high likability and abuse susceptibility. We will discuss various mechanisms that likely contribute to the high abuse rate of oxycodone including clinical drug likability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, differences in its actions within mesolimbic reward circuity compared to other opioids, and the possibility of differential molecular and cellular receptor interactions that contribute to its selective effects.

Patients with chronic pain, including, but not limited to, those with substance use disorders, are particularly vulnerable. Chronic pain patients have twice the risk of death by suicide compared to those without pain, and 50% of chronic pain patients report that they have considered suicide at some point due to their pain. The kappa opioid system is implicated in negative mood states including dysphoria, depression, and anxiety, and recent evidence shows that chronic pain increases the function of this system in limbic brain regions important for affect and motivation. Additionally, dynorphin, the endogenous ligand that activates the kappa opioid receptor is increased in the caudate putamen of human suicide victims. A potential treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts is buprenorphine. Buprenorphine, a partial mu opioid agonist with kappa opioid antagonist properties, reduced suicidal ideation in chronic pain patients with and without an opioid use disorder.

Retrospective cohort study. Data from multiple state agencies in Massachusetts from 2011 to 2015. Adult Massachusetts residents (N=3,078,163) who received at least one prescription opioid during the study period; approximately half (1,589,365) aged 50 and older. We measured exposure to 5 types of PIP: high-dose opioids, coprescription with benzodiazepines, multiple opioid prescribers, multiple opioid pharmacies, and continuous opioid therapy without a pain diagnosis. We examined 3 adverse outcomes: nonfatal opioid overdose, fatal opioid overdose, and all-cause mortality. The rate of any PIP increased with age, from 2% of individuals age 18 to 29 to 14% of those aged 50 and older. Older adults also had higher rates of exposure to 2 or more different types of PIP (40-49, 2.5%; 50-69, 5%; \u226570, 4%). Of covariates assessed, older age was the greatest predictor of PIP. In analyses stratified according to age, any PIP and specific types of PIP were associated with nonfatal overdose, fatal overdose, and all-cause mortality in younger and older adults. Older adults are more likely to be exposed to PIP, which increases their risk of adverse events.

We accounted for competing risks of death and populated the model with primary and published data. We modeled cohorts of 1 million individuals with different injection behavior profiles until age 60 years. We combined model-generated estimates with published data to project the total expected number of IE deaths in the United States by 2030. The probabilities of death from IE by age 60 years for 20-, 30-, and 40-year-old men with high-frequency use with higher infection risk techniques compared to lower risk techniques for IE were 53.8% versus 3.7%, 51.4% versus 3.1%, and 44.5% versus 2.2%, respectively. The predicted population-level attributable fraction of 10-year mortality from IE among all risk groups was 20%. We estimated that approximately 257 800 people are expected to die from IE by 2030.

This population-based retrospective cohort study used linked administrative data of 211,096 deliveries in Massachusetts between 2011 and 2014 to examine the adherence to medications for opioid use disorder. Individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder after delivery were included in the study. Here, demographic, psychosocial, prenatal, and delivery characteristics are described. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression modeling were used to examine factors associated with medication discontinuation. A total of 2314 women who received medications for opioid use disorder at delivery were included in our study. Overall, 1484 women (64.1%) continued receiving medications for opioid use disorder for a full 12 months following delivery. The rate of continued medication use varied from 34% if women started on medications for opioid use disorder the month before delivery to 80% if the medications were used throughout pregnancy.

{"title": "An examination of maternal prenatal BMI and human fetal brain development.", "abstract": "Prenatal development is a time when the brain is acutely vulnerable to insult and alteration by environmental factors (e.g., toxins, maternal health). One important risk factor is maternal obesity (Body Mass Index\u00a0>\u00a030). Recent research indicates that high maternal BMI during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for numerous physical health, cognitive, and mental health problems in offspring across the lifespan. It is possible that heightened maternal prenatal BMI influences the developing brain even before birth. The present study examines this possibility at the level of macrocircuitry in the human fetal brain. Using a data-driven strategy for parcellating the brain into subnetworks, we test whether MRI functional connectivity within or between fetal neural subnetworks varies with maternal prenatal BMI in 109 fetuses between the ages of 26 and 39weeks. We discovered that strength of connectivity between two subnetworks, left anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus (aIN/IFG) and bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), varied with maternal BMI. At the level of individual aIN/IFG-PFC connections, we observed both increased and decreased between-network connectivity with a tendency for increased within-hemisphere connectivity and reduced cross-hemisphere connectivity in higher BMI pregnancies. Maternal BMI was not associated with global differences in network topography based on network-based statistical analyses. Overall effects were localized in regions that will later support behavioral regulation and integrative processes, regions commonly associated with obesity-related deficits. By establishing onset in neural differences prior to birth, this study supports a model in which maternal BMI-related risk is associated with fetal connectome-level brain organization with implications for offspring long-term cognitive development and mental health.", "abstract_id": 32779186, "entities": [{"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Human fetal brain", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fetal neural subnetworks", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "aIN/IFG-PFC connections", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maternal prenatal BMI", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Fetal connectome-level brain organization", "qualifier": null}]}

In the present study, we examine potential malleable early childhood predictors of opioid misuse including whether childhood achievement, aggressive behavior, attention problems, and peer social preference/likability in first grade predicted opioid misuse and whether these relationships differed depending on participant sex. Data are drawn from three cohorts of participants (N = 1,585; 46.7% male) recruited in first grade as part of a series of elementary school-based, universal preventive interventions conducted in a Mid-Atlantic region of the US. In first grade, participants completed standardized achievement tests, teachers reported on attention problems, and peers nominated their classmates with respect to their aggressive behavior and social preference/likability. At approximately age 20, participants reported on their misuse of opioids defined as lifetime use of heroin or misuse of prescription opioids. Higher levels of peer nominations for aggressive behavior in first grade predicted a greater likelihood of opioid misuse. An interaction between participant sex and attention problems was observed such that females higher in attention problems were more likely to misuse opioids, particularly prescription opioids, than females lower in attention problems. An interaction was also found between participant sex and peer likability such that males lower in peer-nominated likability were more likely to misuse opioids relative to males higher in likability.

This study utilizes propensity score methods for causal inference to robustly account for shared risk factors between maternal and offspring smoking. An 8-year longitudinal cohort of 900 adolescents in the Chicago area were followed starting from approximately age 15.6. The effects of maternal lifetime smoking (MLS) and prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) (among participants reporting MLS) on offspring's past 30-day smoking, daily smoking status and smoking frequency were examined using logistic regression and Poisson regression after nearest-neighbor propensity matching. Age dependency of this relationship was then examined across the age range of 15-25 using time-varying effect modeling. Propensity matching yielded 438 and 132 pairs for MLS and PTE study samples, respectively. MLS demonstrated significant associations with past 30-day smoking (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.04-1.14), daily smoking (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.12), and smoking frequency of offspring (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15-1.52), with stable effects across age. Among participants reporting MLS, having PTE showed significant additional effects on daily smoking (RR 1.09; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and age-dependency that showed significance during young adulthood but not adolescence. The relationship between maternal and offspring smoking was not fully accounted for by shared risk factors, suggesting possible causation with PTE having a delayed effect across age.

A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation.

However, what contributes to these racial health disparities remains poorly understood. Using a sample of 1577 older adults (32.7% Black; ages 55-65 at baseline), we examined whether stress, health behaviors, social isolation, and inflammation are associated with racial disparities in self-reported physical health. A latent cumulative stress factor and unique stress-domain specific factors were modeled by applying bifactor confirmatory analysis to assessments across the lifespan (i.e., childhood maltreatment, trauma exposure, discrimination, stressful life events, and indices of socioeconomic status). Physical health, health behavior, and social isolation were assessed using self-report. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assayed from morning fasting serum samples; a z-scored inflammation index was formed across these 2 cytokines. A parallel serial mediational model tested whether race (i.e., Black/White) is indirectly associated with health through the following 3 independent pathways: (1) cumulative stress to preventative health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating) to inflammation, (2) cumulative stress to risky health behaviors (e.g., substance use) to inflammation; and (3) cumulative stress to social isolation to inflammation. There were significant indirect effects between race and self-reported physical health through cumulative stress, preventative health behaviors, and inflammation (B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.02, 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01). Specifically, Black Americans were exposed to greater cumulative stress, which was associated with reduced engagement in preventative health behaviors, which was, in turn, associated with greater inflammation and reduced physical health. A unique SES factor also indirectly linked race to physical health through preventative health behaviors. Cumulative stress exposure and unique aspects of socioeconomic status are indirectly associated with Black-White racial health disparities through behavioral (i.e., preventative health behavior) and biological (i.e., inflammation) factors. Culturally responsive evidence-based interventions that enhance engagement in preventative health behaviors are needed to directly confront health disparities. Ultimately, large scale anti-racist public policies that reduce cumulative stress burden (e.g., a living wage, universal healthcare) may best attenuate racial health disparities.", "abstract_id": 34153589, "entities": [{"entity": "Black Americans", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Stress", "qualifier": ["cumulative"]}, {"entity": "Black Americans", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Preventative health behaviors", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Black Americans", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Inflammation", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Black Americans", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Physical health", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Socioeconomic status", "qualifier": ["unique aspects"]}, {"entity": "Physical health", "qualifier": null}]}

We first applied a data-driven community detection approach to cluster cortical regions into communities, then employed a generative model-based approach called the weighted stochastic block model to further probe community interactions. Children showed similar community structure to adults, as defined by Yeo and colleagues in 2011, in early-developing sensory and motor communities, but differences emerged in transmodal areas. Children have more cortical territory in the limbic community, which is involved in emotion processing, than adults. Regions in association cortex interact more flexibly across communities, creating uncertainty for the model-based assignment algorithm, and perhaps reflecting cortical boundaries that are not yet solidified. Uncertainty was highest for cingulo-opercular areas involved in flexible deployment of cognitive control. Activation and deactivation patterns during a working memory task showed that both the data-driven approach and a set of adult communities statistically capture functional organization in middle childhood.

While previous research has linked parenting daily hassles to child externalizing problems, the role of frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) as a potential modifier of this relationship has scarcely been explored. The present study examined mother-child dyads, most of whom were living in low socioeconomic status households in an urban environment and self-identified as members of racial minority groups. Analyses focused on frustration task electroencephalography (EEG) data from 67 children (mean age = 59.0 months, SD = 2.6). Mothers reported the frequency of their daily parenting hassles and their child's externalizing problems. Frustration task FAA moderated the relationship between parenting daily hassles and child externalizing problems, but resting FAA did not. More specifically, children with left frontal asymmetry had more externalizing problems as their mothers perceived more hassles in their parenting role, but parenting hassles and externalizing problems were not associated among children with right frontal asymmetry. These findings lend support to the motivational direction hypothesis and capability model of FAA.

{"title": "Thalamic subfield iron accumulation after acute mild traumatic brain injury as a marker of future post-traumatic headache intensity.", "abstract": "To explore alterations in thalamic subfield volume and iron accumulation in individuals with post-traumatic headache (PTH) relative to healthy controls. The thalamus plays a pivotal role in the pathomechanism of pain and headache, yet the role of the thalamus in PTH attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains unclear. A total of 107 participants underwent multimodal T1-weighted and T2* brain magnetic resonance imaging. Using a clinic-based observational study, thalamic subfield volume and thalamic iron accumulation were explored in 52 individuals with acute PTH (mean age\u00a0=\u00a041.3; standard deviation [SD]\u00a0=\u00a013.5), imaged on average 24\u2009days post mTBI, and compared to 55 healthy controls (mean age\u00a0=\u00a038.3; SD\u00a0=\u00a011.7) without history of mTBI or migraine. Symptoms of mTBI and headache characteristics were assessed at baseline (0-59\u2009days post mTBI) (n\u00a0=\u200952) and 3 months later (n\u00a0=\u200946) using the Symptom Evaluation of the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-5) and a detailed headache history questionnaire. Relative to controls, individuals with acute PTH had significantly less volume in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (mean volume: PTH\u00a0=\u00a0254.1, SD\u00a0=\u00a043.4 vs. controls\u00a0=\u00a0278.2, SD\u00a0=\u00a039.8; p\u00a0=\u20090.003) as well as more iron deposition in the left LGN (PTH: T2* signal\u00a0=\u00a038.6, SD\u00a0=\u00a06.5 vs. controls: T2* signal\u00a0=\u00a045.3, SD\u00a0=\u00a02.3; p\u00a0=\u20090.048). Correlations in individuals with PTH revealed a positive relationship between left LGN T2* iron deposition and SCAT-5 symptom severity score at baseline (r\u00a0=\u2009-0.29, p\u00a0=\u20090.019) and maximum headache intensity at the 3-month follow-up (r\u00a0=\u2009-0.47, p\u00a0=\u20090.002). Relative to healthy controls, individuals with acute PTH had less volume and higher iron deposition in the left LGN. Higher iron deposition in the left LGN might reflect mTBI severity and poor headache recovery.", "abstract_id": 36651577, "entities": [{"entity": "Individuals with acute PTH", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "LGN volume", "qualifier": ["less"]}, {"entity": "Individuals with acute PTH", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Iron deposition in left LGN", "qualifier": ["more"]}, {"entity": "Iron deposition in left LGN", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "SCAT-5 symptom severity score", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Iron deposition in left LGN", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Maximum headache intensity", "qualifier": null}]}
{"title": "Headache classification and automatic biomarker extraction from structural MRIs using deep learning.", "abstract": "Data-driven machine-learning methods on neuroimaging (e.g. MRI) are of great interest for the investigation and classification of neurological diseases. However, traditional machine learning requires domain knowledge to delineate the brain regions first, followed by feature extraction from the regions. Compared with this semi-automated approach, recently developed deep learning methods have advantages since they do not require such prior knowledge; instead, deep learning methods can automatically find features that differentiate MRIs from different cohorts. In the present study, we developed a deep learning-based classification pipeline distinguishing brain MRIs of individuals with one of three types of headaches [migraine (n = 95), acute post-traumatic headache (n = 48) and persistent post-traumatic headache (n = 49)] from those of healthy controls (n = 532) and identified the brain regions that most contributed to each classification task. Our pipeline included: (i) data preprocessing; (ii) binary classification of healthy controls versus headache type using a 3D ResNet-18; and (iii) biomarker extraction from the trained 3D ResNet-18. During the classification at the second step of our pipeline, we resolved two common issues in deep learning methods, limited training data and imbalanced samples from different categories, by incorporating a large public data set and resampling among the headache cohorts. Our method achieved the following classification accuracies when tested on independent test sets: (i) migraine versus healthy controls-75% accuracy, 66.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity; (2) acute post-traumatic headache versus healthy controls-75% accuracy, 66.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity; and (3) persistent post-traumatic headache versus healthy controls-91.7% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity. The most significant biomarkers identified by the classifier for migraine were caudate, caudal anterior cingulate, superior frontal, thalamus and ventral diencephalon. For acute post-traumatic headache, lateral occipital, cuneus, lingual, pericalcarine and superior parietal regions were identified as most significant biomarkers. Finally, for persistent post-traumatic headache, the most significant biomarkers were cerebellum, middle temporal, inferior temporal, inferior parietal and superior parietal. In conclusion, our study shows that the deep learning methods can automatically detect aberrations in the brain regions associated with different headache types. It does not require any human knowledge as input which significantly reduces human effort. It uncovers the great potential of deep learning methods for classification and automatic extraction of brain imaging-based biomarkers for these headache types.", "abstract_id": 36751567, "entities": [{"entity": "Deep learning-based classification pipeline", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Brain MRIs", "qualifier": ["Migraine", "Acute post-traumatic headache", "Persistent post-traumatic headache", "Healthy controls"]}, {"entity": "Deep learning methods", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Aberrations in brain regions", "qualifier": ["associated with different headache types"]}, {"entity": "Deep learning methods", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Biomarkers", "qualifier": ["for different headache types"]}]}
{"title": "Multi-domain biopsychosocial postoperative recovery trajectories associate with patient outcomes following lumbar fusion.", "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe and assess the impact of multi-domain biopsychosocial (BPS) recovery on outcomes following lumbar spine fusion. We hypothesized that discrete patterns of BPS recovery (e.g., clusters) would be identified, and then associated with postoperative outcomes and preoperative patient data. Patient-reported outcomes for pain, disability, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and social roles were collected at multiple timepoints for patients undergoing lumbar fusion between baseline and one year. Multivariable latent class mixed models assessed composite recovery as a function of (1) pain, (2) pain and disability, and (3) pain, disability, and additional BPS factors. Patients were assigned to clusters based on their composite recovery trajectories over time. Using all BPS outcomes from 510 patients undergoing lumbar fusion, three multi-domain postoperative recovery clusters were identified: Gradual BPS Responders (11%), Rapid BPS Responders (36%), and Rebound Responders (53%). Modeling recovery from pain alone or pain and disability alone failed to generate meaningful or distinct recovery clusters. BPS recovery clusters were associated with number of levels fused and preoperative opioid use. Postoperative opioid use (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and hospital length of stay (p\u2009<\u20090.01) were associated with BPS recovery clusters even after adjusting for confounding factors. This study describes distinct clusters of recovery following lumbar spine fusion derived from multiple BPS factors, which are related to patient-specific preoperative factors and postoperative outcomes. Understanding postoperative recovery trajectories across multiple health domains will advance our understanding of how BPS factors interact with surgical outcomes and could inform personalized care plans.", "abstract_id": 36877367, "entities": [{"entity": "Lumbar spine fusion", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "BPS recovery clusters", "qualifier": ["Gradual BPS Responders", "Rapid BPS Responders", "Rebound Responders"]}, {"entity": "BPS recovery clusters", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Number of levels fused", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "BPS recovery clusters", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Preoperative opioid use", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "BPS recovery clusters", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Postoperative opioid use", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "BPS recovery clusters", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Hospital length of stay", "qualifier": null}]}
{"title": "A Pilot Study of Training Peer Recovery Specialists in Behavioral Activation in the United States: Preliminary Outcomes and Predictors of Competence.", "abstract": "The peer recovery specialist (PRS) workforce has rapidly expanded to increase access to substance-use disorder services for underserved communities. PRSs are not typically trained in evidence-based interventions (EBIs) outside of motivational interviewing, although evidence demonstrates the feasibility of PRS delivery of certain EBIs, such as a brief behavioral intervention, behavioral activation. However, characteristics that predict PRS competency in delivering EBIs such as behavioral activation remain unknown, and are critical for PRS selection, training, and supervision if the PRS role is expanded. This study aimed to explore the outcomes of a brief PRS training period in behavioral activation and identify predictors of competence. Twenty PRSs in the United States completed a two-hour training on PRS-delivered behavioral activation. Participants completed baseline and post-training assessments, including roleplay and assessments of PRS characteristics, attitudes towards EBIs, and theoretically relevant personality constructs. Roleplays were coded for competence (behavioral activation specific and PRS skills more broadly, i.e., PRS competence) and changes were assessed from baseline to post-training. Linear regression models tested factors predicting post-training competence, controlling for baseline competence. There was a significant pre-post increase in behavioral activation competence (t = -7.02, p < 0.001). Years working as a PRS significantly predicted post-training behavioral activation skills (B = 0.16, p = 0.005). No variables predicted post-training PRS competence. This study provides preliminary evidence that behavioral activation may be appropriate for dissemination to PRSs through brief trainings, particularly for PRSs with more work experience. However, additional research is needed to examine predictors of competence among PRSs.", "abstract_id": 36900912, "entities": [{"entity": "Peer Recovery Specialist (PRS)", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Behavioral Activation", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Behavioral Activation", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Competence", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Years working as a PRS", "qualifier": null}, {"entity": "Behavioral Activation skills", "qualifier": ["post-training"]}]}
